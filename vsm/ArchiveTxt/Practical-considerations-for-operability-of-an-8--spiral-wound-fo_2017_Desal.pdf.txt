abstract

A better understanding of large spiral wound forward osmosis (SW FO) module operation is needed to provide
practical insight for a full-scale FO practical implementation desalination plant. Therefore, this study investigated
two different 8∪ SW FO modules (i.e. cellulose tri acetate, CTA and thin lm composite, TFC) in terms of hydrody-
namics, operating pressure, water and solute uxes, fouling behaviour and cleaning strategy. For both modules, a
signicantly lower ow rate was required in the draw channel than in the feed channel due to important pres-
sure-drop in the draw channel and was a particularly critical operating challenge in the CTA module when
permeate spacers are used. Under FO and pressure assisted osmosis (PAO, up to 2.5 bar) operations, the TFC mod-
ule featured higher water ux and lower reverse salt ux than the CTA module. For both modules, fouling tests
demonstrated that feed inlet pressure was more sensitive to foulant deposition than the ux, thus conrming
that FO fouling deposition occurs in the feed channel rather than on the membrane surface. Osmotic backwash
combined with physical cleaning used in this study conrmed to be effective and adapted to large-scale FO
module operation.

1. Introduction
The most commonly used desalination technologies are generally
pressure-based membrane processes such as reverse osmosis (RO)
and nanoltration (NF). However, the wider development of these pro-
cesses is often limited due to high membrane fouling and scaling pro-
pensity and high energy consumption, resulting in operation and
maintenance costs [1每3]. As a potentially more sustainable alternative,
the use of forward osmosis (FO) has been recently put forward and ex-
tensively investigated. In FO, the driving force is an osmotic pressure
gradient, allowing water to naturally ow from a low chemical potential
feed solution (FS) to a concentrated high chemical potential draw solu-
tion (DS) through a semipermeable membrane [4,5]. Although direct
cost comparison of FO with conventional NF and RO systems remains
a challenging task, several studies have demonstrated that desalination
by FO could lead to lower energy consumption, reduced fouling propen-
sity and higher cleaning efciency [5每7].
Recent interest in FO applications has been particularly driven by the
performance improvement offered by the latest generation of FO mem-
branes. The improvements include higher water permeability, greater
selectivity and rejection, smoother active layer surface allowing lower
fouling propensity, and quite importantly, a specically adapted porous
support layer offering low internal concentration polarization (ICP) yet
still appropriate mechanical support for practical operation [4,5]. The
rst commercially available and specically tailored FO membranes,
based on cellulose triacetate (CTA), were developed by Hydration Tech-
nology Innovations (HTI, Albany, OR), and have been examined in vari-
ous applications by numerous research groups [8每13]. More recently,
thin lm composite (TFC) FO membranes were designed with a poly-
amide selective layer, and these feature higher water ux and better sol-
ute rejection compared to CTA membranes [14每17]. In addition, TFC
membranes were found to be more pH stable and were more resistant
to hydrolysis and biological degradation [17每19]. In contrast, previous
studies have reported that TFC membranes showed higher fouling ten-
dency than CTA membranes due to the increased surface roughness [17,
18,20,21]. As such opportunities to increase ux with commercially
available membrane exists, but long-term fouling studies are required.
An optimised FO module design is expected to feature high membrane
packing density, lower concentration polarization (i.e., high mass trans-
fer coefcient) and high water permeation [22]. Performance of several
commercial FO membranes (i.e., Porifera and Toyobo) has been widely
reported in the literature on small membrane samples but information
regarding module design is still limited since most commercial FO
membrane modules are still under development. Only the performance
of SW FO modules developed by HTI has been reported for a variety of
feed and draw spacers (ne, medium and corrugated spacer) [12]
while detailed information on other suppliers module congurations
are not available. This clearly indicates that CTA and TFC membrane
modules were the most mature and developed membranes during the
time of this FO study. In this regard, most studies so far were conducted
using small at sheet membrane coupons which are not always repre-
sentative of behaviour in full-scale modules. Therefore, a better under-
standing of FO behaviour in larger modules is needed to provide more
practical insight for full-scale FO operation.
A large-scale spiral wound (SW) FO module typically requires four
ports: two inlets and two outlets for both the FS and DS. In SW FO mod-
ules, the FS circulates in the feed channel between the rolled layers, and
the DS ows through the central tube into the inner side of the mem-
brane envelop [23]. Therefore, ow patterns and ow resistance in the
feed and draw channels can be different and affected by specic module
design. In particular, a more detailed study linking operating conditions
(ow rates, inlet pressures) to resulting performances (water ux, re-
verse salt ux, fouling and cleaning efciency) of SW FO modules will
provide important insights in the operability of current SW FO modules
on full-scale.
Very limited pilot-scale FO studies using SW FO modules currently
exist in literature [23每25]. However, these pilot studies are of crucial im-
portance for further FO development since the operation of SW modules
in industrial plants is affected by several factors such as the number of
membrane leaves, feed and draw channel height, spacers that affect
mass transfer and pressure loss, but also fouling potential [26]. To the
best of the author's knowledge, so far only two studies have been re-
ported in literature using 4040 SW (4∪ in diameter and 40∪ in length)
[24] and 8040 SW (8040, 8∪ inch in diameter and 40∪ in length) [23]
HTI CTA FO modules. Those studies mainly focused on the optimisation
of a large-scale SW FO module [24] and of a newly proposed fertiliser
drawn forward osmosis process for a specic application [23,27]. How-
ever, the susceptibility of SW FO modules to membrane fouling during
the long-term FO operation has not been considered in those studies,
which could consequently exacerbate the performance of in full-scale
FO stand-alone or hybrid process. Although membrane fouling on the
feed side in FO happens less and is easily removed by simple physical
cleaning [3,28,29], the effect of osmotic backwash seems to be unclear.
Some studies have reported that the osmotic backwash could lead to
an adverse effect on the driving force due to the accumulation of the re-
versed solutes within the fouling layer [29每31]. Nevertheless, the specif-
ic combination of osmotic backwash with subsequent physical cleaning

could be more effective to restore a signicant portion of water produc-
tivity after fouling occurred [32]. Thus, there is a critical need to control
operating conditions and assess performances of SW FO modules more
systematically including fouling behaviour and cleaning strategies for
sustainable FO operation.
As an alternative to FO, a new FO-derived concept called pressure
assisted osmosis (PAO) has recently been developed. PAO is aimed at in-
creased water production compared to FO for more favourable econom-
ics for further commercialization [32每36]. In PAO, hydraulic pressure is
applied on the feed side of the membrane to enhance the water ux
through the synergistic effects of hydraulic pressure and osmotic pres-
sure [32每36]. Overall, it has been demonstrated that by increasing the
applied pressure, the water ux was signicantly improved despite
higher ICP. Even more than for FO, the role of a spacer in the PAO process
is important to prevent the deformation and damage of the membrane
caused by the applied hydraulic pressure on the feed side of the mem-
brane [34,36,37]. This reinforces the need to evaluate the impact of hy-
draulic pressure on the module-scale FO and PAO operations.
Accordingly, there is a clear need for a detailed assessment of the im-
pact of hydrodynamic conditions on pressure behaviour of an SW FO
module (i.e. build-up in draw stream and drop along feed line). This
study therefore systematically studied the performances of two com-
mercial SW FO modules (CTA from HTI and TFC from Toray Industries
Inc.). An assessment of the water ux and reverse salt ux behaviours
as a function of operating conditions in both FO and PAO operation
was conducted to evaluate the performance of both modules compared
to lab-scale experiments. Fouling studies were performed with a mix-
ture of model organic foulants was then used to evaluate the fouling be-
haviour and cleaning strategies for the modules operated in a seawater
dilution application. To our best knowledge, this is the rst study ad-
dressing the practical operations of commercially available 8∪ SW FO
modules and providing a comparative assessment of long-term fouling
behaviour in large-scale FO process. Therefore, the results reported in
this study can be useful for further investigation of the fouling control
by chemical cleaning and/or pre-treatment in full-scale FO operation.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Spiral wound FO membrane module

Two different 8∪ SW FO modules were used (Table 1): one CTA mod-
ule manufactured by HTI and one TFC polyamide module manufactured
by Toray Industries, Korea. In both modules, the rejection layer of the
membrane faces the FS and the porous support layer of the membrane
faces to the DS. Feed and permeate spacers were present to keep the
membrane leaves apart [23,24].
As presented in Table 1, the CTA module had a corrugated feed spac-
er made of 2.5 mm polystyrene chevron and an effective membrane
area of 9 m2 with six membrane leaves. The TFC module had a feed spac-
er made of a 1.19 mm diamond type polypropylene mesh and an effec-
tive membrane area of 15 m2 with ten membrane leaves. In addition,
both modules had different permeate spacers: the CTA module had
three tricot spacers, while the TFC module featured a draw channel con-
taining one diamond type spacer wedged in between two tricot type
spacers. If a net spacer is used inside of the envelope in the SW FO mod-
ule and the DS side is pressurized, the feed ow channel may be blocked
by membrane deformation. Accordingly, a tricot fabric spacer is used in-
side the envelope like a permeate carrier of an SW RO module and pre-
vents the membrane deformation and this structure has been already
utilised for pressure-retarded osmosis application [38]. Water perme-
ability (A) for both FO modules was measured in RO mode in a pilot-
scale FO unit (tap water - conductivity 240 ㊣ 20 米m/cm - in the feed
and draw sides). The tests were conducted at increasing feed pressures
(in intervals of 0.5 bar up to 2.5 bar). ACTA and ATFC were found to be
1.6 ㊣ 0.2 and 8.9 ㊣ 0.14 Lm 2 h 1 bar 1, respectively. Additional in-
formation on the properties of the CTA and TFC FO membranes such

as water and salt permeability (A and B values), feed rejection (R),
structural parameter (S) and membrane total thickness are all provided
in the Table S2 in the Supplementary Information.

2.2. Feed and draw solutions

A draw solution at a concentration of 35 g/L of Red Sea salt (RSS)
from Red Sea Inc. with an equivalent osmotic pressure of 24.7 bar was
prepared and used in all experiments [32,33]. RSS composition is de-
scribed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Information. Humic acid and
alginate were chosen as model organic foulants, while calcium (as calci-
um chloride, CaCl2) was added to further enhance fouling. Model organ-
ic foulants used in this study have been known as major organic
components in wastewater and have extensively been used to study
in fouling behaviour in FO process [32,39,40]. In fouling experiments,
the FS was prepared by mixing the following chemicals to tap water:
1.2 g/L RSS, 0.22 g/L CaCl2 (Ajax Finechem Pty Ltd., Tarend point,
Australia), 0.2 g/L humic acid sodium salt (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WIS)
and 0.2 g/L alginic acid sodium salt (Sigma Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO).
The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the feed was 94 mg/L.
Before and after the fouling experiments, baseline experiments were
conducted using tap water and 35 g/L RSS as FS and DS, respectively.

2.3. Pilot-scale system and experimental procedure

As shown in Fig. 1, a pilot-scale FO system was used for the experi-
ments. Details about the design and control of the pilot-scale FO system
are provided in our previous study [23]. Flow meters, pressure gauges
and electrical conductivity (EC) meters were installed at both the inlet
and outlet points of the module and connected to a computer for online
data recording and monitoring. Although the feed and draw ow rates
were varied between 17 and 100 L/min and between 4 and 15 L/min, re-
spectively, the cross-ow velocity of each module shows difference due
to their different module designs. The converted feed and draw cross-
ow velocities for both are presented in Table 2.
The impact of feed and draw ow rates on pressure-drop were suc-
cessively evaluated. For this evaluation, 500 L of FS and DS were pre-
pared with tap water, and each experiment was carried out at a xed
draw ow rate, while the feed ow rate was varied and vice versa. De-
tails of the experiment conditions are summarized in Table 2.
PAO operation was also tested to assess the effect of the hydraulic
pressure in the feed channel. Feed pressure was changed by adjusting

the back pressure valve for xed feed and draw ow rates. The maxi-
mum operating pressure used in this study was 2.5 bar as feed inlet
pressure. The PAO experiments were performed with 200 L of 35 g/L
RSS as DS and 500 L of tap water as FS. The feed and draw ow rates
were constant and xed based on the optimised conditions dened in
the initial SW FO module experiments.
Water uxes (Jw, Lm 2 h 1) were calculated by using the following
formula:

where Am is the effective membrane surface area (m2) and 忖t is the op-
eration time (hr). In addition, the recovery rate (%) during the operation
in FO and PAO modes was dened as

When tap water was used as FS in FO and PAO modes, the change in
FS salt concentration (and thus reverse salt ux) was determined based
on conductivity measurements (using a multimeter CP-500 L, ISTEK,
Korea) [6]. The concentration change in the feed solution at the begin-
ning and end of each experiment was measured. The measured value
was used to calculate the specic reverse solute ux (SRSF), which is de-
ned as a ratio of reverse salt ux (Js, gm 2 h 1) and water ux (Jw,
Lm 2 h 1) [34,41]. SRSF (Js/Jw, g/L) was then calculated using the fol-
lowing formula:

where Ci and Cf are the initial and nal feed solute concentration (g/L),
and Vi and Vf are the initial and nal volume of the feed water (L). When
DI water was used as FS, the RSF/SRSF was determined by measuring
the increased electrical conductivity of the FS between the start and
end of each batch experiment. The electrical conductivity was then con-
verted into mass concentration using calibration curve for the RSS con-
centration versus conductivity as shown in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary
Information.

2.4. Fouling cycles and cleaning experimental procedure

Fouling behaviour was evaluated in FO operation (no hydraulic pres-
sure added, i.e. back pressure valve opened) for both modules. All ex-
periments were conducted with 200 L of 35 g/L RSS as DS and 500 L
mixed fouling solution (as described in Section 2.2) as FS. After 400 L
of water permeated (i.e. after 80% recovery feed water reached), the
test was stopped and new feed and draw solutions were prepared and
a new fouling cycle was initiated (without cleaning in-between cycles).
Fouling runs were repeated for three cycles in total, before cleaning took
place. Operation time for the CTA module was much longer than for the
TFC module due to its low water permeability (since similar permeation
volumes were aimed at).
Osmotic backwashing was conducted after the three fouling cycles,
using 200 L of 35 g/L RSS as cleaning DS (replacing the feed water)
and tap water as cleaning feed solution (replacing the DS) for 60 min
to remove the fouling layer from the membrane surface at the same
feed and draw ow rates of 40 and 10 L/min, respectively for both mod-
ules (cross-ow velocities for each module are shown in Table 1). After
the osmotic backwash, physical cleaning at 100 L/min of feed ow rate
(0.44 and 0.91 m/s for CTA and TFC modules, respectively) was per-
formed for 5 min using tap water to ush the dislodged foulants from
the feed channel [32]. During the physical cleaning, samples of the
feed side (used as draw side during the backwashing) were collected
every 1 min (100 L ushing), and analysed using a total organic carbon
(TOC) analyser (SGE Anatoc TOC II Analyser). Before each fouling run, as
well as before and after cleaning, the baseline ux was measured by op-
eration with tap water as FS and 35 g/L as DS for 30 min to assess the

inuence of fouling on membrane permeability and inlet pressure
(and pressure-drop) in the feed channel.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Impact of operating conditions on module hydrodynamics

3.1.1. Impact of feed and draw ow rates on pressure-drop (without
permeation)
It should be noted that the ow rate range is much lower in the draw
channel, as recommended in [23,24]. Results for the CTA module
(Fig. 2(a)) indicate that the effect of feed ow rate increase on the pres-
sure-drop was moderate (at constant draw cross-ow velocity of
0.04 m/s). When the feed cross-ow velocity was increased from 0.08
to 0.44 m/s, the feed inlet pressure was increased from 0.17 to
0.27 bar. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2(b), when the draw cross-ow
velocity was increased from 0.03 to 0.05 m/s (much lower range than
for feed stream), the draw inlet pressure was more linearly increased
from 0.39 to 0.74 bar. This demonstrates that much higher ow resis-
tance occurs in the draw channel of the CTA module, which is mainly
due to the use of dense and thick draw tricot spacers with lower
cross-ow velocities in both sides of the module (Table 1) [42].
When the feed cross-ow velocity was increased from 0.16 to
0.91 m/s in the TFC module (Fig. 2(c)), the feed inlet pressure was in-
creased from 0.22 to 0.39 bar. Specically, under much higher feed
cross-ow velocity of 0.91 m/s (Table 1), the feed inlet pressure with
the TFC module is slightly higher (0.39 bar) than that with the CTA mod-
ule (0.27 bar), which corroborates with the fact that the spacer used in

the feed channel of the TFC module is thinner (1.19 mm) with higher
packing density leading to lower feed channel height (0.00258 mm for
TFC and 0.00394 mm for CTA), resulting in higher feed inlet pressure
[26,43,44]. Pressure-drop in the draw channel of the TFC module was
not only lower but also much less sensitive to ow rate variation than
in the CTA module, mainly due to the presence of one layer of diamond
spacer with much lower resistance in the draw channel (Fig. 2(d)).
As such, it is clear that spacer design is of crucial importance for pres-
sure-drop in the SW FO module. The tested CTA module with a corru-
gated spacer in the feed channel does allow a very low pressure drop
in the feed channel, but this comes at the cost of a low packing density.
Most likely, this is only justiable economically if feed waters with a
very high load of foulants and potential clogging problems is treated.
In that aspect, the diamond spacer used in the TFC module appears to
be a better compromise that allows for higher packing densities at mod-
erate pressure drop. The permeate spacers used in the CTA module re-
sulted in a very large pressure drop, even at low ow rate.
Combinations of tricot permeate spacers to support the membrane
and limit deformation and a diamond spacer to limit pressure-drop
(as in the TFC module) allows using higher draw ow rates.

3.1.2. Impact of feed and draw channel pressurisation on pressure-drop
In these experiments, the system was operated by adjusting the feed
inlet pressure using the back pressure valve of the feed side. Fig. 3 shows
the impact of the feed inlet pressure on the feed and draw channel inlet
and outlet pressures for both modules. For both modules (Fig. 3(a) and
(b)), the draw inlet pressure was increased when pressure was applied

on the feed side. Interestingly, both modules have very distinct behav-
iour with regards to this ※pressure transfer.§ For the CTA module, the
draw inlet pressure increase is already maximal at lower hydraulic pres-
sures (1 bar), and remains constant even when further increasing the
feed pressure (up to 2.5 bar). This appears to indicate that the
pressurisation of the draw side in the CTA module is more likely a con-
sequence of draw channel pressurisation on the tricot type support on
the draw side. At higher pressures, further reduction of the channel is
not possible as the tricot support could not be more compacted. For
the TFC module, a more linear increase in the draw inlet pressure was
observed with increasing feed pressure (Fig. 3(b)). Here, it could thus
be hypothesized that the diamond type spacer is less supportive and al-
lows for more channel reduction [33,45]. To identify the reason behind
the increases in draw pressure for both modules, RO tests with the mod-
ules were compared to tests in FO mode (using tap water as FS and DS).

3.2. Relative contribution of hydraulic pressure to permeation ux

FO and PAO tests were carried out using CTA and TFC modules
(Fig. 4), and now with tap water as FS, and 35 g/L RSS as DS. The
water uxes in FO and PAO modes with the TFC module were signi-
cantly higher than that with the CTA module. For example, in FO
mode (no hydraulic pressure applied), the ux with the TFC module
was around 16.6 Lm 2 h 1, while the ux with the CTA module was
around 5.4 Lm 2 h 1. The higher performance of the TFC membranes
compared to CTA membranes corroborates ndings from literature
[16,46].

In PAO mode (Fig. 4), as expected, the water ux improved with in-
creasing applied pressures. For the CTA module, the ux increase with
applied pressure was moderate, i.e., from 6.72 to 7.3 Lm 2 h 1 (at
2.5 bars of applied pressure) and remained much lower than the uxes
obtained with the TFC module. For the TFC module, the impact of the ap-
plied pressure on the water ux was signicant, already at low applied
pressure (ux increased from 19 to 24.5 Lm 2 h 1 at 1 and 2.5 bar, re-
spectively). This conrms that the TFC membranes not only has higher
permeation ux in FO mode, but is also are more responsive to the
use of hydraulic pressure (PAO mode) due to its higher water perme-
ability. Although additional energy is required to pressurise the feed so-
lution in PAO, the signicant increase in performance could lead to
additional cost savings, in particular by a reduction of the number of
membrane modules required [47].
Table 3 shows the comparison of the specic reverse salt ux (SRSF)
behaviour for FO and PAO modes using the two different SW FO mod-
ules. Compared to the CTA module, the TFC module had much lower
SRSF, and thus not only had a higher ux but also a higher selectivity
than the CTA module. As expected from the previous lab experiments,
the results show a signicant decrease in the SRSF for both modules
with increasing applied pressure. For example, the SRSF were 1.22 and
0.37 g/L for CTA and TFC, respectively in FO mode, and decreased
down to 0.64 and 0.10 g/L for CTA and TFC, respectively in PAO mode
with a feed inlet pressure of 2.5 bar [33,34,36]. This corroborates previ-
ous ndings that reverse transport of the draw solutes through the
membranes is signicantly decreased by the enhanced water perme-
ation. The effect of hydraulic pressure on the RSF for the TFC is even
more propounded compared to the CTA, due to the higher water perme-
ability of the TFC. Also, the CTA module could have the risk of irrevers-
ible fouling on the support layer caused by more solute diffusing from
DS into FS in which the enhanced salt accumulation on the feed side
of the CTA module and is mainly promoted by the reverse diffusion of
Na+ [48,49]. Such reverse solute ux through the FO membranes can
have signicant economic impact on the FO process. Draw solute leak-
ages through SRSF in the FO process is one of the major contributors
to draw solute replenishment cost in a continuous closed-loop congu-
ration [50]. A recent study conducted by Phuntsho et al. [51] has pointed
out that accumulation of draw solutes in the feed brine would be one of
the signicant environmental challenges for brine disposal, especially
for FO membranes with lower reverse ux selectivity. This indicates
that, CTA with lower reverse ux selectivity (as shown in Table 3)
would result in much higher accumulation of draw solutes in the feed
bine thus leading to higher draw replenishment and brine treatment
costs. These studies clearly show that the TFC FO membrane with
much higher reverse ux selectivity than CTA FO membrane would be
more benecial for FO hybrid systems.

3.3. Fouling behaviour in SW FO modules and impact on hydraulic
performance

The water ux as a function of permeate volume is presented in
Fig. 5(a) and (c) while permeate volume and recovery rate as a function
of operation time is shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d). During each batch, ux
decreased signicantly with time (and increasing recovery) due to a
combination of the osmotic dilution of the DS and potentially fouling.

Only when comparing initial permeation uxes for batches, occurrence
of fouling can be individually assessed. No signicant initial permeation
ux decline with batches was observed for neither of the tested mod-
ules, even after three batches of operation without cleaning in between.
As such, despite the relative long time of operation, especially for the
CTA module, and the high load of foulant used, a faster ux decline
was noticed at early stages of operation but between fouling experi-
ments the ux decline was relatively small (Fig. 5(a)). For the TFC mod-
ule (Fig. 5(b)), fouling was limited, although a higher impact of fouling
was initially expected due to the higher roughness of the membrane
sand the higher permeation ow compared to the CTA [1,52]. Such little
ux decline for TFC module shows that the fouling happening in the SW
FO module is clearly different from the results reported in existing liter-
ature, which was conducted using small FO membrane coupons [21,53,
54]. This study seems to suggest that the membrane surface properties
play a less dominant role in SW FO module fouling.
Nevertheless, there was the steep decrease of the initial water ux
was observed with CTA module, and the initial recovery rate between
the CTA and TFC modules was signicantly different (recovery rate of
10% and 2% for CTA and TFC modules, respectively), resulting in the
huge difference of operation time for CTA and TFC modules (i.e. 20
times higher). This was more likely because of two reasons; the impact
of ECP on the membrane surface of the CTA module mainly due to
higher RSF (discussed in Section 3.2) and that the CTA module used in
this study has been operating several times before we conducted the
fouling experiments, thus it could already have a fouling layer on the
membrane surface to some extent even though the ux was almost
fully restored after hydraulic cleaning [51]. More specically, it was ob-
served that the recovery rate of the CTA module after 10 h operation
was around 1% with water ux of lower than 1 Lm 2 h 1 and thus
there was no meaning to operate CTA module longer than 10 h
(Fig. 5(a)). From this aspect, CTA and TFC module conguration in a
full-scale FO desalination plant cannot be the same and it is dependent
on the performance of FO membrane modules. Thus, it is more preferred
that CTA modules should be paralleled in a full-scale FO desalination
plant.
To get further insight in the behaviour of the SW FO modules during
the fouling (as no real decrease in water permeability was noticed over
the bathes), feed inlet pressure was compared before and after the foul-
ing experiments. Fig. 6 compares the feed inlet pressure during fouling
experiments with the feed pressure using pure water as feed before
and after the third batch of fouling. As shown in Fig. 6, as soon as the
foulant mixture was used as FS, a much higher feed inlet pressure was
observed in the module, due to higher viscosity resulting in an increase
ow resistance and pressure-drop along the membrane channel on the
feed side. This feed pressure increase most likely indicates foulant depo-
sition, although no decrease in permeation ux was noticed. This would
indicate that fouling occurs more in the channel spacers rather than on
the membrane surface. Most likely, the foulants accumulated in dead
zone of the feed spacer, and consequently, the cross-ow velocity and
the required pressure increased in the feed channel. Despite the fact
that no decrease in membrane water permeability is seen, the increased
pressure-drop in the feed channel is of course unwanted. Increased
pressure drops lead to higher energy consumption for the pump to
maintain the water circulation [26]. As such, controlling fouling in the

Fig. 3. Impact of feed inlet pressure on the feed and draw channel pressurisation with (a) CTA and (b) TFC modules. Feed cross-ow velocity was constant at 0.18 m/s for CTA and 0.37 m/s
for TFC, while the draw ow cross-ow velocities for CTA and TFC modules were 0.04 and 0.09 m/s, respectively. Tap water was used as FS and DS.

feed channel, and avoiding unwanted pressure-drop will be a key pa-
rameter for real-life FO operation, especially on challenging feed
streams. By comparing feed pressure (with tap water as FS) before
and after fouling experiments, it is clear that for the TFC module, pres-
sure-drop increased much more than for the CTA one (i.e. 1 and
0.25 bar, respectively). As discussed earlier, the corrugated spacer
used in the CTA module leads to an increased channel thickness with
lower initial pressure-drop and most likely less sensitivity to fouling de-
position with much longer operation time. In addition, since the CTA
module has shown lower cross-ow velocity of around 0.18 m/s com-
pared to the TFC module (0.37 m/s) corresponding to the ow rate of
40 L/min, thus showing that mass transfer coefcient of TFC module
(3.04 ℅ 10 5 m/s)
is higher
than that of CTA module
(2.40 ℅ 10 5 m/s). Consequently, the loose fouling layer in the
corrugated spacer can be ushed to some extent or changed by hydro-
dynamics due to its spacer geometry (Fig. 6).

3.4. Fouling reversibility by osmotic backwash

As discussed in Section 3.3, no signicant impact of fouling was ob-
served on permeation ux, indicating that fouling occurs more in the
spacers rather than on the membrane surface in the SW FO modules.
Therefore, it is unclear whether osmotic backwashing will have a clear
effect on fouling remediation. To assess this, not only the water

Fig. 4. Comparison of ux behaviour in pilot-scale FO and PAO processes using two
different SW FO modules. Experimental conditions: feed ow rate: 0.18 and 0.37 m/s for
CTA and TFC, respectively, draw ow rate: 0.04 m/s for CTA and 0.09 m/s for TFC, and
applied pressure in PAO: 1, 2 and 2.5 bar, 35 g/L RSS as DS and tap water as FS.

permeability was monitored, but also the potential recovery of the pres-
sure-drop in the feed channel. The cleaning strategy consisted in a com-
bination of osmotic backwash followed by feed channel water ushing
at high cross ow velocity (Section 2.4). During the osmotic backwash,
the feed pressure drop remained relatively constant for the CTA module,
but was observed to decrease slightly for the TFC module (see Fig. 7(a)).
This indicates that the osmotic backwashing could be efcient to recov-
er materials accumulated in the feed channel during operation, espe-
cially for TFC membrane module. Besides, as shown in Fig. 7(a),
signicant reverse ux difference between CTA and TFC modules was
observed during the osmotic backwash. For instance, the reverse
water permeation in the TFC module (average of 14.5 Lm 2 h 1) was
much higher than that in the CTA module (average of 2.8 Lm 2 h 1), in-
dicating that reverse ux assisted dissociation and dislodging of the
foulant layer from the membrane surface could be more pronounced
in the TFC FO membrane modules. The results in Fig. 7(b) therefore
have conrmed that the feed inlet pressure was dramatically decreased
after osmotic backwashing and ushing the feed channel under the
highest cross ow velocity for each module, i.e. from 1.4 to 0.8 and
from 0.35 to 0.25 for TFC and CTA modules, respectively. Still, the feed
pressure was not restored to its original level for the clean module,
thus indicating that almost full recovery was achieved or modication
of the pressure balance in the module happened.
In order to compare the efciency of the cleaning and estimate re-
quired durations for both modules, TOC concentrations ushed out of
the module after each minute (i.e. 100 L) are presented in Fig. 7(c).
The results indicate that a very high load of foulants is removed in the
early stage of physical cleaning and after 3 min (300 L), the TOC level
returns to that of the incoming tap water and no more foulants are
ushed out the module. As such, it is clear that for the foulants used in
this study, only a very short period of physical cleaning is required
after osmotic backwash. Consequently, the combination of osmotic
backwash and physical cleaning has proven to be an efcient cleaning
strategy for the SW FO modules.

4. Conclusions

This study presented practical considerations of SW FO modules
with different membrane properties (CTA and TFC). The evaluation of
two modules was conducted to establish hydrodynamic conditions
under different feed and draw ow rates. In addition, the performances
of two SW FO modules under different operation modes (FO and PAO
modes) were compared. Finally, the effectiveness of the combined

osmotic backwash and physical cleaning on the ux recovery was eval-
uated. The following conclusions are drawn:

 The draw side of the CTA module was more sensitive to ow rate due
to the use of permeate spacers thick tricot creating more resistance to
the ux. The operation of the draw side of the TFC module is less re-
strictive thanks to a mesh spacer but then less mechanical support is
provided to the feed stream in the module. Also, pressure transfer
from the feed to the draw channel was observed in PAO operation
due to the potential compaction and narrowing of the draw channel.
 Novel TFC membranes allow for higher permeation ux and is more
responsive to hydraulic pressure (PAO)
 In PAO mode, enhanced water permeation caused by the additional
hydraulic pressure on the feed side of the TFC module led to less RSF
which is benecial for process efciency and potentially to limit
(RSF enhanced) fouling propensity.
 Fouling tests demonstrated that fouling occurs even when only limit-
ed impact on permeation is observed. Pressure-drop can be an impor-
tant indicator of fouling occurrence for practical SW FO operation.
 The combination of osmotic backwash and physical cleaning con-
rmed to be very efcient and easy to implement on a module scale.
Nevertheless, it has to be acknowledged that further studies of effec-
tive cleaning strategies for FO process including chemical cleaning
have to be conducted for improvement of techno-economic assess-
ment of FO by evaluating organic removal efciency and feed inlet
pressure recovery.

Although this study demonstrated that the application of PAO oper-
ation enables to enhance the water ux and to limit the RSF in both SW
FO modules, further studies on the comprehensive assessment of the
PAO process including long-term operations are required. This can
help to dene optimal design for FO and PAO processes to prevent the
pressure and energy losses caused by fouling in the system.
