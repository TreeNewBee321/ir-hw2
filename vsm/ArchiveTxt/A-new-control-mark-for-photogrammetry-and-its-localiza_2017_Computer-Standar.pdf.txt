abstract

Computer Vision takes part in many industrial applications mainly in robotics and measurement systems. Geodesy 
uses computer vision rather indirectly using specialized software tools for measurements of data captured with 
digital cameras or LIDAR systems. This paper describes new control mark and its advantages for deformation 
measurements, and surface reconstruction. Furthermore, we describe control mark detection method using com- 
puter vision algorithms, and its localization from single image. We also compare this method to spatial polar 
method.

1. Introduction 

Reconstruction of surface and structure of objects is important task in 
many industrial applications. Very popular method for surface or object 
reconstruction is known as photogrammetry well described in Kapica 
and Sladkova [5] . The information we obtain from most photogrammet- 
ric systems using control marks are three-dimensional positions of the 
marks. We have focused on stereo-metrical system with control marks, 
where the main measurement tool is a camera. The user takes multiple 
images of the measured object with control marks from dierent angles, 
and then the three-dimensional coordinates of each mark are computed. 
This measurements are done repeatedly over time to measure the shift 
and deformation of the monitored object well described in DIAS-DA- 
COSTA [14] . The important part of every photogrammetric system is 
detection of control marks using computer vision techniques. Good de- 
tection rate and precise measurement of the control mark are essential 
for reliable results. We have been working on an improvement of detec- 
tion rates of control marks and a way for extraction of more data from 
them. 
Every control mark have to be easily distinguishable from the envi- 
ronment it is located in. Therefore, the control mark is often realized as 
an image with high contrast colors or intensities (in most cases black and 
white), MORIYAMA [15] . Also, the shape of the mark should be very dif- 
ferent from shapes of the objects that are naturally present in surveyed 
locations. These premises allows photogrammetric tools to easily detect 
those marks in the image with higher reliability (lower number of false 
detections). Hereby we can say that the use of control marks with simple 
shape like circle is highly unreliable and the user is forced to mark the 
marks on the image manually. 

We have designed a new control mask, which is more complex, and 
therefore, it is less likely that there will be similar objects in the im- 
age causing false detection. Furthermore, the mark is designed in such 
a way, that we can easily extract its three-dimensional rotation. This 
is useful mainly when we are measuring deformation of the object of 
interest. We also propose a photogrammetric method using only single 
camera image for three-dimensional localization. We describe the new 
control mark, and new localization method in greater detail in following 
sections. 
Testing detection of newly proposed targets took place both in the 
laboratory conditions and outdoors on the retaining wall no. 8246 in 
the undermined part of the D1 motorway in Ostrava, the city district 
of Svinov. The results of the testing show that the location of targets 
and their detection can also be successfully applied to more complex 
constructions in the real environment. 

2. Control mark 

The control mark must be easily visible and distinguishable from the 
environment we are going to place it into. Therefore, the mark must 
have high contrast colors or intensities and its shape should be more 
complex than objects usually present in most locations to make it more 
distinguishable from the surveyed environment. It must provide more 
than one coordinate, so it would be possible to extract its rotation in 
three-dimensional space, and to estimate it position from single image, 
for dicult situations, when it is not possible to take more images from 
dierent angles (e.g. narrow areas). 
We have designed a control mark, which meets all given require- 
ments. As seen in Fig. 1 , it is rectangular with specially designed inter- 
nal pattern to ensure its uniqueness. It is also diagonally asymmetrical, 
and therefore, we can conclusively extract its rotation. Consequently, 
each point on the mark can be uniquely identied. The border around 
the mark ensures its relatively easy distinction from other objects in the 
image. We describe the detection algorithm in the following section. 

3. Control mark detection 

The object detection is important task in computer vision. There are 
numerous methods for this task. Well researched domains of object de- 
tection include face detection described in Yang et al. [12] and pedes- 
trian detection described in Enzweiler and Gavrila [3] . The most known 
detector tools are SVM developed by Cortes and Vapnik [2] and Ada- 
Boost developed by Viola and Jones [11] . These detectors are trained, 
and therefore, they need training sets consisting of positive samples 
(consisting the object of interest) and negative samples (other objects 
or parts of background image) to work. There are also moving object 
detectors based on background subtraction described in Malik et al. [6] . 
These methods are learning the background of the image (slowly mov- 
ing or stationary objects) and subtracts the foreground (moving objects). 
Another, method for object detection is to analyze a contour of the ob- 
ject extracted from image segmentation or directly from image gradient. 
The last mentioned method is most suitable for our task, because it is 
working correctly also for rotated and scaled images. This is important, 
because our marks can be positioned from dierent distances, angles, 
and with dierent rotations as it can be seen in Fig. 2 . 
Our detection method consists of few fundamental steps. First, we 
lter the image noise to reduce its inuence on detection. Then we ex- 
tract important edges and corners from the image. After that, we nd 
continuous contours from edges consisting only four corners (rectangu- 
lar control mark). Extracted contours are candidates for our detected 
mark. The last step is to test each candidate against predened pattern 
(expected appearance of the control mark) using algorithm known as 
pattern matching. This step is done for multiple permutations of the cor- 
ner points to nd the right orientation of the control mark. This method 
is described in further detail in following subsections. 

ing variation of color and brightness. It is error caused by sensor chip of 
the camera. If this noise is not ltered out, the edge and corner detec- 
tors will not work properly. Therefore, we use image ltering to reduce 
noise. 
The most used image lter for noise reduction is Gaussian lter de- 
scribed in Stockman and Shapiro [10] . The Gaussian function is used as 
a kernel function for image convolution with noisy image. Gaussian l- 
ter reduces random image noise very eectively, but with the noise also 
the edges in the image are blurred. This is due to properties of edges 
and noise in frequency domain of the image. Both noise and edges are 
represented by frequencies and the Gaussian blurring works as a low- 
pass lter in frequency domain. To preserve edges in the image other 
method for ltering must be used. 
The lter we have used is known as Perona-Malik lter developed 
by Perona and Malik [8] . This lter preserves important details in the 
image, typically edges and lines, which is important for our method. 
This lter is based on heterogeneous diusion described by following 
equation 


 

=  

 ( 

 


 ) 

,

where I represents image, t is time,  represents gradient operator, and c 
is diusion coecient. The diusion coecient is very important in the 
equation. It describes behavior along the edges in the image. The basic 
idea is to slow down the diusion process (ltering) along the edges. 
This way, similar intensities are ltered more, and therefore, creating 
homogeneous areas separated by preserved signicant edges. The dif- 
fusion coecient is driven by image gradient magnitude and has the 
following form

where K represents a sensitivity to edges. The result of image ltering 
using the Perona-Malik lter can be seen in Fig. 3 . As you can see, the 
detail of control mark is much more homogeneous than in original im- 
age, yet the edges are preserved. This step signicantly improves edge 
and corner detection. 

3.2. Edges and corners detection 

3.1. Image ltering 

Image ltering is a process used for reduction of undesirable proper- 
ties of the image. Image noise is random component of the image caus- 

Corners and edges are important features for our control mark de- 
tector. Edges are parts of the image, where image intensities change 
rapidly (high gradient magnitude). We are often looking for thin edges

corresponding with boundaries of the objects in the image. On the other 
hand, corners are areas in the image, where the edges rapidly change 
its shape, for example intersection of two lines. Combination of edges 
and corners is essential for control mark detection. The basic idea is to 
nd continuous contour having exactly four corners, because it is exact 
representation of our control mark boundaries. 
We have used Canny edge detector developed by Canny [1] also 
known as optimal detector, because it is adaptable to various environ- 
ments. This algorithm consists of four basic steps. The First step is to l- 
ter the image. The authors proposed to use Gaussian lter, but we have 
already ltered the image using the Perona-Malik lter. The second step 
is to nd image gradient magnitudes and orientations. The Sobel opera- 
tors are used for this task. Convolution of Sobel operators with the input 
image creates two output images with approximated partial derivations 
for x-axis and D y 
for y -axis. This step can be described by following 
equations

where G is gradient magnitude image, and 成 is gradient orientations 
image. The orientations are often rounded to one of four angles (0, 45, 
90 or 135). Third step is to apply Non-maximum suppression to lter 
out every pixel that is not in local gradient maximum. Only pixels which 
form thin edges remain. The last step is to threshold pixels according to 
gradient magnitudes. There are two thresholds: upper and lower. If a 
pixel gradient is above the higher threshold, then the pixel is accepted 
as edge. If a pixel gradient is under the lower threshold, it is rejected. 
If it is between lower and upper threshold, it is accepted only if the 
pixel is connected to pixel with gradient above upper threshold. The 
result of Canny edge detector can be seen in Fig. 4 b. We must make the 
edges more thick, because we are going to use the edges in combination 
with corners, and they must be on the border of the control mark. We 
have used dilatation for this task. The result of dilatation can be seen in 
Fig. 4 c. 
The corner can be dened as a point in the image, where two edges 
intersect, or as a point in the image which has at least two signicant 
edges in the neighborhood with dierent orientations. The algorithm 
we have used is called Harris corner detector or it is also referred to as 
Harris operator developed by Harris and Stephens [4] . This operator is 
improved Moravec corner detector proposed by Moravec [7] . This im- 
proved corner detector uses dierentials of the corner score with respect 
to direction. First step is to compute approximation of a sum of squared 

dierences (SSD), denoted as S , which is computed as form

where w is a window function (usually Gaussian), D x

Typically, the corner is indicated, when the S has high variations in 
all directions of the vector ( x y ). Following step is to analyze eigenval- 
ues of the matrix A . If both eigenvalues 
and 
have values near 0, 
then the point has no feature of interest. If 
is near to 0 and 
has 
large positive value, then the point is marked as edge. Finally, if both 
and 
have large positive number, the point is marked as corner. It 
is suggested that we should not compute eigenvalues exactly, and use 
following computation instead and analyze its value

where M c 
is the value we have to analyze, and 
 is sensitivity coecient, 
which should be set between 0 . 04  0 . 15 as the authors suggest. The 
result of corner detector combined with edge detector can be seen in 
Fig. 4 d. 

3.3. Detection 

As an input for detection the edges and corners with input image are 
used. The detection itself can be described in three basic steps. First, we 
nd all contours with four corners, then we nd corresponding permuta- 
tion for the corner points to match the contour orientation with template 
orientation, and nally, we compare the template pattern with detected 
object within the detected contour. 
First we nd the contours using connected components algorithm. 
Subsequently, we compute the number of corner in each contour, and 
if it is four, we mark the object as a candidate for the control mark. An 
example of result from this step can be seen in Fig. 5 . In our example, 
the number of candidates is reduced to one. 
Now we only have the objects with four corners, and we must nd 
only those, that look the same as our control mark. We use pattern 
matching for this task. The problem is, that we do not know the order 
of corners of the object, and also, the object in the image is transformed 
(rotated, scaled). These problems must be dealt with. We use a combi- 
nation of corner permutations and perspective transformation known as 
homography. 
Homography is a transformation for projection between two planes. 
It is often used in road surface monitoring systems, where we want to 
have a bird-like (up-down) view on the road around the car. To nd 
a perspective transformation we need at least four points in the input 
image and four points in the output image for exact computation of the 
homography matrix H . The matrix H represents a transformation matrix

for the points from one image plane to the other in such a way, that 
the transformation transforms the input points onto the output points 
with minimal projection error. The homography can be described using 
following formulas

is used. Furthermore, the lowest SSD is also used for decision if the de- 
tected object is our control mark (thresholding is used). The transformed 
images in comparison with template image with measured SSD can be 
seen in Fig. 6 . In this gure, the transformed image nearest to control 
mark pattern (the one with least SSD) is the one we consider to have 
corners in the correct order. Now we know positions of the point on 
the control mark in the image, therefore, we can use it to measure the 
location of the mark itself (e.g. using stereoscopy). 

4. Measuring control mark position from single image 

We need to know positions of control marks to reconstruct three- 
dimensional model of measured object, and also to measure its occa- 
sional deformation. In many cases, it is dicult to measure in hardly 
accessible places with limited room for camera manipulation. There- 
fore, we were highly motivated to develop a simple method for control 
mark localization using only single camera image. 
As we have mentioned earlier, the increased complexity of control 
mark makes it more dicult for detection, but on the other hand, more 
complex control mark decreases the probability there will be any other 
object in the image causing false detection. Another asset with complex 
marks is that we know its structure and also distances between its cor- 
ners (points of interest). Knowing enough information about the object 
we are trying to detect and about camera we are using for measurement 
allows us to measure its position. 
The rst part of the information we have to acquire the intrinsic and 
extrinsic camera parameters. We would need these two also if we were 
using stereoscopy for measurement. These parameters are important for 
distortion compensation and also for information about focal length and 
center of the view-port. These data are essential for reconstruction of the 
measured object. Without these data the measurement would be unnec- 
essarily inaccurate. Number of points of interest is also very important

where p a 
is input point from input image plane, p ∩ b 
is output point in 
output image plane, H ab 
is projective transformation used for transfor- 
mation of the point p a 
onto the point p ∩ b 
, x and y are image coordinates, 
and w ∩ homogeneity coecient for conversion of point p ∩ b 
to point p b 
. 
To nd the homography matrix H the basic Direct Linear Transforma- 
tion Algorithm (DLTA) is used. 
The idea of distinction between control marks and other objects is 
given by comparison of sample pattern with data extracted from the 
image (pattern matching). First we must transform object dened by 
detected contour from input image into the same image space as the 
sample pattern (register both images using homography). Since both 
images are registered we can compare them pixel by pixel using the 
previously mentioned SSD. This comparison is done for each possible 
and logical permutation of the corners (no edge is crossing the other 
edge), and as the result, the order of the corners with the lowest SSD

part in object localization. We need at least four point and theirs relative 
positions to nd three-dimensional position of an object. 
In our case, we have four points in each detected object and also all 
camera parameters. This is enough to nd three-dimensional position 
of the control mark. We use re-projection for the localization itself. The 
idea is to project the known shape of the control mark (corner points) 
onto the view-port in such a way, that it matches the detected mark 
in the image. Therefore, we need to nd unknown projection param- 
eters, namely, translation and rotation vector. Parameters for camera 
matrix are known from camera calibration. Many optimization method 
can be used to nd the unknown translation and rotation vectors. We 
have used genetic algorithm described in Schmitt [9] , which is heuristic 
search method inspired in natural selection. Every evolutionary algo- 
rithm uses some kind of tness function to evaluate the tness (quality) 
of the solution. We will discuss these ideas in greater detail in following 
subsections. 

4.1. Genetic algorithm 

Genetic algorithm is a method for heuristic search for optimal re- 
sults. The method works with multiple results at the same time. Each 
result is encoded in structure known as chromosome and all results to- 
gether form a new generation (population). Each generation has one or 
more representatives from previous generation known as parents, which 
represent the former best results. Each new generation is created using 
the parents (best results) from former generation. To fulll this task, the 
crossover, mutation, and selection operators are used. 
Crossover operator also known as recombination represents the com- 
bination of the best results (parents) to create new generation (results). 
According to encoding if the information the crossover operator varies. 
For example, if the information is encoded in binary manner (each bit 
represents gene), then the crossover operator will randomly select each 
bit from one of the parents and copies it to a new chromosome in the 
upcoming generation. Whole new generation is created this way. 
Another important operator is mutation. This operator introduces 
diversity into the population. The diversity is important for heuristic 
search. After crossover each of the chromosomes are combination of the 
best chromosomes, but these chromosomes without mutation are all the 
same, and therefore, the mutation is introduced. This operator changes 
each chromosome (result) a bit so each population covers greater part 
of search space. In the case of binary encoding, random bits (genes) are 
inverted. This prepares the ground for the nal operator, the selection. 
Selection operator selects new parents for the next generation. In 
nature only the best individuals survive. The same principle applies for 
genetic algorithms. Only the best chromosomes are selected to be used 
in next generation. We need some kind of a measure to evaluate the 
tness of each individual. This measure is a tness function, which is 
dierent for each application. For example, for the problem of nding 
a maximum of a function the tness function is the evaluation of the 
function itself. The higher is the value the higher is the tness. We will 
discuss our application of genetic algorithm in the following subsection. 

4.2. Estimation of projective matrix 

The camera parameters as focal length and center of the view-plane 
are already known, but we have to estimate rotation and translation 
vectors. Estimation of these parameters will allow us to nd location 
of object of interest. The rst step is to put control mark model into 
the center of projection and then estimate the translation and rotation 
which will put projected model onto detected object in the image. We 
nd these parameters using genetic algorithm. 
First problem we have to solve is the encoding. We have six param- 
eters in total: rotation along three axes ( 
   ), and translation vector 
). We encode these parameters as an array of oat values. So 
each chromosome in population has six genes represented as oat val- 
ues. The mutation operator is then dened as an addition of random

vector to chromosome. And for the selection operator (tness function) 
the re-projection error is used. Re -projection error uses points in de- 
ned space 次 and points in dierent space 忙 projected to space 次 using 
transformation matrix P (projection) P: 忙 ↙ 次 . The squared dierences 
between actual and projected points are then used for tness function. 
This re-projection error can be expressed using following equation

where x i 
﹋ 次 is an image point detected on control mark, x i 
0 ﹋ 忙 is con- 
trol mark point in three-dimensional space, which can be transformed 
onto the view-port (two-dimensional image) using transformation ma- 
trix P . Finally, N represents number of control points present on the 
control mark, which is four in our case. Hereby, we can say, that we are 
looking for such transformation P min 
with minimal re-projection error, 
for which the following equation is valid

where argmin represents the search of the transformation matrix P min 
in search space 忙 containing all possible transformations. In our case, 
this function is realized using genetic algorithm. As soon as we nd the 
transformation, we can nd three-dimensional position of control mark 
with transformation of control mark using only rotation and translation. 

5. Experiments 

The accuracy of detection of new control marks and determination 
of their spatial position were conducted under laboratory conditions. 
To verify the accuracy of the values obtained from detection the geode- 
tic method known as spatial polar method was used. The test included 
brackets for control marks and simple micro-network for geodetic mea- 
surements. Brackets allow any shifts and rotations of control marks. 
Micro-network consists of two reective plates representing the approx- 
imate line. Diagram of the test unit is shown in Fig. 7 . 

5.1. Spatial polar method 

The spatial polar method shown in Fig. 8 is based on the measuring 
of slope length d from the known point (survey station S ), horizontal 
angle (for the determination of the bearing) and zenith angle z to the 
determined point (detailed survey point P ). The equations for the cal- 
culation of coordinate dierences between the survey station S and the 
determined point P resulting from proposed scheme are as follows

The bearing 
 , as shown in Fig. 9 , is an angle which is closed 
by the parallel with the positive semi-axis X pointing to the south, 
passing through the station S , and by the requested side. The bearing 
therefore cannot be directly measured, hence the horizontal angle 



from another known point (orientation O ) is observed. The bearing 
is calculated from the bearing 
(determined from the known 
coordinates of the points S and O ) and the measured horizontal angle 
 using the expression

5.2. Measurements 

Coordinates of the center marks measured using geodetic method 
were calculated in Groma 9.1 software. Furthermore, the calculated co- 
ordinates of the spatial distance between the two marks were compared 
with the length computed from coordinates of control marks detected by 
our photogrammetric method. Table 1 contains rst attempt for a com- 
parison of both methods on a series of 4 images. From the measured 
data we can compute the mean error as follows

to improve accuracy. Recently, we have prepared a new test platform 
that allows us to measure control markers in laboratory conditions for 
longer distances. Then the method will be tested in a similar manner 
also in the exterior and compared with geodetic methods. 

6. Testing 

Detecting the image, or a suitable target in space can also be used 
for example for monitoring the structural deformation. The spatial shifts 
of structures occurs mainly due to anthropogenic and natural factors. 
In the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, it is mainly the case of the eects 
of mining activities. Although most of the coal mines in the Ostrava- 
Karvina district are already closed, according to Schenk [13] , it can take 
several years before the impact of mining in the subsidence trough fades 
away. 
Monitoring shifts, not only on the undermined territory, can prevent 
deformation and, in extreme cases, the devastation of the structure. A 
number of methods, either geodetic or physical, are used for the mea- 
surement of the values used for the calculation of the shifts. 
For further testing of the detection of new targets, the retaining wall 
no. 8246 on the D1 motorway in Ostrava was used, which is part of the 
yover in Rudn芍. The retaining wall is located in close proximity to the 
safeguard pillar of the former Odersk Pit and Svinov Pit. Both pits were 
already liquidated in 1992, so it is assumed that the eects of mining on 
the surface have faded away. The retaining wall no. 8246, however, is a 
very important part of the viaducts and one of the reasons for monitor- 
ing the shifts is its position in the undermined area. Monitoring spatial 
displacements takes place at 56 points since 2004. 
The monitored points, which are stabilized by reective labels, 
have been supplemented by new code targets with dimensions of 
0.15 m ℅ 0.15 m. They were also photographed using the digital camera 
Canon EOS 7D. Photographing had to be done in stages because of the 
size of the wall. 
The detection of the bull＊s-eyes, as shown in Fig. 10 , was carried 
out without problems even on such a large object, and their position in 
space was determined for all of them. Their position was also determined 
using the spatial polar method by the total station Leica TS 30 (angle 
accuracy: 0,15 mgon; distance accuracy: 1 mm + 1 ppm), and the mean 
error of the detection of targets was determined. The mean error of new

We can deduct from our measurements that the accuracy of our 
method is about ㊣ 7﹞10

future, we are planning modications to our software which are going

photogrammetric methods for testing on the retaining wall no. 8246 was 
㊣ 0.007 m. 
However, the problem arose when calculating the shifts. It is not 
yet possible to dene reference points or the coordinate system in the 
software. For the calculation of shifts in the coordinate system of the 
darkroom, the targets would have to be photographed at various stages 
in the same position of the darkroom. 
Since the rst trials, however, the software has been adjusted for the 
detection of the mark. The software innovation should lead to better 
and more accurate results. It will include the possibility of dening the 
reference points, coordinate system and scale. 
Currently, a new test base is being prepared, which allows pho- 
tographing marks in laboratory conditions and for longer distances. 
Then the method will be tested in a similar way also in the exterior 
and compared with geodetic methods. 

6.1. The method application 

The newly proposed one-snap photogrammetric method can have 
a wide range of applications. The fundamental dierence from terres- 
trial intersection photogrammetric method is to determine the spatial 
coordinates of the center of the target from only one image. Newly de- 
veloped software also determines the spatial coordinates in addition to 
also rotate targets in space. The new method can thus be used for moni- 
toring the displacement of various types of structures. However, targets 
of a suitable material would have to be placed on the object. A sample 
location of the target is shown in Fig. 11 . 
Aesthetically, it would be possible to adapt the color of the target 
not to disturb the overall impression of the structure. However, their 
basic shape must be respected. The big advantage of the newly proposed 
method is the possibility of continuous monitoring of the targets. In 
the next phase of testing, this possibility will be tested with a CMOS 
sensor, or a simple darkroom. In the case of quality results, there is the 
possibility of connecting the darkroom with the GSM module that would 
send the images to the server with the evaluation software. 

7. Conclusions 

We have developed a new photogrammetric method for localization 
of control marks from single image. We have also designed a new control 

mark that can be used with our new method. The newly designed control 
mark allows us to measure not only its position, but also to measure its 
rotation, which can be very useful for measured surface reconstruction. 
The ability to measure the position of control marks from single image 
allows to measure tide or generally small areas, where more images from 
more dierent angles cannot be taken. We have compared our method 
to spatial polar method and we deduced that the accuracy of our method 
is about ㊣ 7﹞10
