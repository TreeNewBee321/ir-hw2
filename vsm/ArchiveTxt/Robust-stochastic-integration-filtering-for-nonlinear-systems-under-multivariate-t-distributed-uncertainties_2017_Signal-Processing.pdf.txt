abstract

Bayesian ltering solutions that are developed under the assumption of heavy-tailed uncertainties are 
more robust to outliers than the standard Gaussian ones. In this work, we consider robust nonlinear 
Bayesian ltering in the presence of multivariate t -distributed process and measurement noises. We de- 
velop a robust stochastic integration lter (RSIF) based on stochastic spherical-radial integration rule that 
achieves asymptotically exact evaluations of multivariate t -weighted integrals of nonlinear functions that 
arise in nonlinear Bayesian ltering framework. The superiority of the proposed scheme is demonstrated 
by comparing its performance against the cubature Kalman lter (CKF), a robust CKF, and the standard 
SIF in a representative example concerning bearings-only target tracking.

1. Introduction 

Bayesian ltering provides a theoretical framework for recursive 
estimation of unknown dynamic state vectors in linear/nonlinear 
ltering applications. In Bayesian paradigm, the posterior proba- 
bility of the state vector given the noisy observations is recur- 
sively updated, at each instant, using a process and a measure- 
ment model. However, in general, the evaluation of the posterior 
probability is analytically intractable, and hence only approximate 
solutions are available [1] . A widely used approximation utilizes 
the assumption that the required posterior distribution is Gaussian 
and the corresponding lters are termed as the Gaussian assump- 
tion (GA) lters [2] . In Table 1 , we list a number of important GA 
lters available in the literature. The Gaussian assumption, how- 
ever, is frequently violated in practice. For instance, the occurrence 
of outliers is a type of non-Gaussian phenomenon which is found 
in many applications of practical interest [3] . Consequently, lters 
based on the Gaussian assumption perform poorly in the presence 
of outliers. 
A lter can be made robust to outliers by incorporating heavy- 
tailed uncertainties in the process and measurement models. A 
popular choice in literature is the use of multivariate generaliza- 
tion of Student t -distribution [2,4每6] ; hereafter, referred to as t - 
distribution. In Table 2 , we list a number of robust lters that 
rely on the assumption of t -distributed uncertainties. An early at- 
tempt to incorporate t -distribution in the Kalman ltering frame- 
work was discussed in [7] ; however, the approach is purely one di- 
mensional and cannot be extended to multivariate case. In [3,5,8] , 
t -distributed uncertainties have been incorporated in the Bayesian 
ltering framework using the variational Bayes (VB) approach. In 
VB method, a solution is developed by converting the intractable 
posterior probability density function into a tractable factored 
form. The resulting factors are, however, coupled and the proce- 
dure requires a number of xed-point iterations to obtain an ad- 
missible solution. A more direct approach has appeared in [4] , 
where an approximate closed-form solution has been developed 
for systems under t -distributed process and measurement noise; 
however, the solution is valid for linear systems only. 
In [2,6] , the Student t -lter of Roth et al. [4] is extended to 
nonlinear systems using sigma-point methods that employed de- 
terministic cubature rules to evaluate multivariate t -weighted non- 
linear integrals. Such deterministic cubature rules, though compu- 
tationally ecient, lead to approximate integral evaluations. Conse- 
quently, they perform inadequately in problems involving nonlin- 
earities with large uncertainties [9,10] . On the other hand, numeri- 
cal integration based on stochastic methods can achieve asymptot- 
ically exact evaluations [10每12] . The motivation behind our work 
is to employ the stochastic integration methods in the develop- 
ment of a robust nonlinear Bayesian lter assuming t -distributed 
process and measurement noises. We rst describe stochastic in-

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes briey 
the existing statistical linear regression based Bayesian ltering 
under t -distributed uncertainties [2,5,13,14] . Section 3 describes 
generic stochastic evaluation rules for t -weighted spherical-radial 
integrals, and obtains a third-degree t -weighted stochastic in-

on the third-degree integration rule as developed in Section 3 . 
Section 5 presents simulation results, and Section 6 draws conclu- 
sions.

Scalars are represented by small letters, and matrices are rep- 
resented by capital letters. Bold-faced small letters are used for 
column vectors that represent states and measurements; whereas, 
bold-faced capital letters are used to represent a set of column vec-

tors, respectively. The system model f (

and v k 
rep- 
resent the uncertainties. To incorporate the effect of possible out- 
liers w k

noise sequences, { w k

and identically distributed. Let Y k 
 be the set of 
all available observations up until the k th instant. The aim of the 
ltering process is to provide an estimate of the state vector given 
. We know that the optimal Bayesian estimate, in terms of min- 
imum mean square error, is given by

 i.e., 
p(

ing a time-update and a measurement-update . Before we develop 
the expressions for these updates, we list two important properties 
of t -distribution that are utilized in the subsequent derivations; re- 
fer to [24] for proof.

in general, do not admit closed-form solutions. In contrast to con- 
ventional sigma-point methods, here, in this work, we suggest to 
apply stochastic integration methods [11] for an approximate yet 
accurate evaluation of I ( s ). 
First, we transform x 
 where 
T and 
 1/2 is a lower triangular matrix stemming from the Cholesky 
 . Accordingly, the Student t -weighted inte- 
decomposition of 
=: 
gral is written as 
s 
(
)
 St 
(
g(
)
 St 
(
 :=
I (g)
 where g(
)
)
 . Secondly, we introduce a change 
of variable to convert the multi-variate integral into a radial- 
spherical form [11] , i.e., we let c 
 with z z 
 and 
 :=

where the weights {

where {

Remark 2. The spherical-radial rule in (24) is a d th-degree rule if 
a) it is exact for a g ( x ) that can be described by a linear combina- 
tion of monomials up to degree d . b) It is not exact for at least one 
monomial of degree d 
 1 . Moreover, if the radial rule in (22b) and 
the spherical rule in (23) are both d th-degree, then the resulting 
spherical-radial rule in (24) is d th-degree as well [9] .

3.1. Stochastic radial rule

3.2. Stochastic spherical rule 

A stochastic spherical rule can be developed by modifying a 
given deterministic rule; we have the following proposition:

orthogonal matrix, then S Q

Remark 3. We can develop a stochastic spherical rule of an arbi- 
trary degree using Proposition 2 and any of the various determin- 
istic rules available in the literature [9,26] . The standard method 
for generating 
 is to set it equal to the Q matrix of the QR - 
℅ n random matrix X , where each entry of 
factorization of an n 
(0

X is independent and distributed in

ods can be found in [27] .

Remark 4. To achieve global convergence, the stochastic integra- 
tion is evaluated N m times and averaged. For each evaluation, in- 
老 and 
dependent realizations of random entities 
 are consid- 
ered. From (28) , we note that each iteration operates for 2 n 
points. Hence, the total number of function evaluations required 
is 
(2 n 
 1)
 N m . Note that the CKF [15] requires 2 n function eval- 
uations; consequently, the complexity of the proposed scheme is 
approximately N m times greater than that of CKF lter.

The results are depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 . We note that the l-

RCKF and the proposed RSIF signicantly outperform the standard 
Gaussian assumption based CKF and SIF. Furthermore, we observe 
that the proposed RSIF performs better than robust CKF lter in 
terms of peak RMSE; however, RCKF performs slightly better than 
the proposed scheme during the transition period and both lters 
show similar performance in steady-state.

posed lter is lesser by 50.7%, 51.2% and 51.4% when compared to 
CKF, SIF and RCKF, respectively. Thus, under heavy-tailed uncertain- 
ties, the proposed lter seems to be quite a promising substitute 
for the traditional counterparts. 

6. Conclusions 

In this work, we discussed the utilization of spherical-radial 
stochastic integration rules for nonlinear Bayesian ltering in the 
presence of multivariate t -distributed uncertainties. We specically 
developed a robust third-degree stochastic integration lter (RSIF) 
for the estimation of state variables under heavy-tailed uncertain- 
ties. Under the inuence of outliers, the performance of the pro- 
posed lter was compared with the standard cubature Kalman l- 
ter (CKF), the stochastic integration lter (SIF), and a robust vari- 
ant of CKF in a nonlinear tracking scenario. It is observed that the 
proposed lter is highly robust to the presence of heavy-tailed un- 
certainties, and can outperform a number of existing solutions.
