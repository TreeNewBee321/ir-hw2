abstract

The current methods of measuring screw threads are either time consuming or expensive. In addition, no
single measurement method is available and capable of accurately measuring all screw thread features
while signicantly reducing the measurement time. This paper introduces a vision system for automatic
measurement and inspection of most types of screw threads. Many image processing and computer vision
algorithms have been developed to analyze the captured images of screw threads and perform the mea-
surement and inspection processes. Most of the common screw thread features (18 features) could be
measured by the introduced vision system. The system has been calibrated for both imperial and metric
units and was veried by measuring a standard ISO metric thread plug gage and comparing the results of
the measurements with the standard values. The results showed that the maximum difference between
the standard and measured values was ㊣5.4 lm, which provide a good accuracy for measurement.

1. Introduction

Screw threads probably are among the most important of all
machine elements. Threaded pipe joints are commonly used in var-
ious industries such as petroleum, transport, and mining [1].
According to the statistics, the threaded connections generally
account for 15% of the total mechanical parts in each machinery
and equipment. The frequency of using screw thread is so high in
the industrial production so that it also plays an important role
to do real-time high-precision measurement and to improve the
quality of accessories [2].
Due to the basic design of a screw thread, which involves helical
geometry, screw thread technology is complex [3]. Methods of
measuring threads are as varied as the threads themselves. These
methods include coordinate measuring machines (CMM), prole
projectors, laser measurements, measuring microscopes, 3-wire
units, screw thread micrometers and V-groove micrometers. On
the other hand, methods of thread inspection range from lasers
to xed and variable limit gauging.

There are about 30 separate geometrical features and dimen-
sional characteristics in the design and construction of screw
threads [4]. The most rigorous standard in the United States
inspects 11 major thread characteristics [5]. In addition, recent
researches [6,7] explored the effect of thread dimensional noncon-
formity on fastener performance and it was reported that dimen-
sional nonconformity of 150% out of tolerance for pitch diameter
yielded a 4% reduction in tensile strength. Therefore, the measure-
ment and inspection of screw threads are very important to ensure
the required degree of accuracy and conformity [8].
Due to the importance of measuring screw thread features,
research in the eld of measuring screw thread is still underway.
For example, Laczik [9] introduced a derivation of geometrical fea-
tures of the screw surfaces with the exact mathematical forms.
Fujun et al. [10] presented a method, which used optical tech-
niques and image processing techniques to measure the physical
dimension of tube thread and give further analysis. Zhang and
Zhang [11] introduced an online contact measuring system that
can automatically detect large screw threads by using the neotype
gauge head of threads. They used spectrum analysis to analyze the
dynamic error and to obtain the data of the functional diameter.
They reported that the neotype gauge head of thread is capable
to get the error and the relative changes of the functional diameter
of the screw thread. Tong et al. [12] introduced a system for auto-
matic measurement of screw thread parameter based on the the-
ory of laser measurement. The inspection and estimation of the
screw thread contour were done using position sensitive device
(PSD) to measure the coordinate data of the screw thread contour
and using precise raster to measure the axial displacement of the
precision worktable. Gadelmawla [13] developed a non-contact
measurement system using a measurescope, personal computer
and developed software, for measuring and inspecting most of
the common types of screw threads. Kosarev and Sugrobova intro-
duced a method to inspect the quality of the prole of an internal
screw thread produced by means of plastic deformation of metal is
determined [14].
The current methods of measuring screw threads are either time
consuming or expensive.
In addition, no single measurement
method is available and capable of accurately measuring all screw
features while signicantly reducing the measurement time.
Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a non contact measur-
ing system, based on the computer vision techniques, for measuring
and inspecting the most common features of external screw
threads.

2. Implemented vision system

A vision system consists of two main parts, hardware and a
developed software, has been used. The hardware is used to cap-
ture images for screw threads to be measured and the software
is used to analyze the captured images and perform the measure-
ment and inspection processes.

2.1. System setup

As shown in Fig. 1, the hardware consists of three items. The
rst item is the backlighting table, which is a lighting box with dif-
fusing surface at its front, and it is used to produce a back lighting
for the screw thread to be measured. The second item is a CCD
color video camera and a set of lenses with different focal lengths.
The camera is carried by a camera holder and it is connected to a
PC computer through a USB connection. Capturing software is pro-
vided with the CCD camera to acquire images with different reso-
lutions up to 4.2 Mp (2048  2048 pixels).
The developed software, named MISTVision (Measurement and
Inspection of Screw Threads by Vision), is fully written in-house
using Microsoft Visual C++ as a 32-bit Windows application. It
features many image processing and computer vision algorithms
to measure and inspect screw thread features from captured
images. Fig. 2 shows the main interface of the MISTVision software.

2.2. Capturing images

Before capturing images for screw threads to be measured, the
vision system was adjusted to capture images that satisfy the fol-
lowing criteria:

1. The screw thread to be measured is set on the backlighting table
so that its axis appears horizontally in the captured image.
2. The CDD camera is adjusted so that the image of the screw
thread appears as maximum as possible in the capturing soft-
ware window.
3. At least, three complete threads should appear in the captured
image for both the upper and lower proles of the screw thread.
4. The left and right sides of the captured image should be
opened, i.e., there is no background at the left or right sides
of the image.
5. The size of the captured images will affect the accuracy of mea-
surement, as it will be discussed in Section 5.3; therefore, the
vision system was adjusted to capture images of size
2048  2048 pixels to obtain good accuracy (5 lm/pixel).

3. The developed algorithms

Several image processing and computer vision algorithms have
been developed and applied to the captured image to perform the
measurement and inspection processes. Fig. 3 shows the procedures
of applying these algorithms and the following sections explain
them.

3.1. Image processing algorithms

The aim of the image processing algorithms is to extract the
coordinates of the pixels that constitute the upper and lower pro-
les of the screw threads. These coordinates will be utilized by
developed computer vision algorithms to measure the screw thread
features. Five image processing algorithms were used: image seg-
mentation, edge pixels detection, edge pixels thinning, edge pixels
labeling, and edge pixels arrangement (EPA). The rst four algo-
rithms were explained in a previous work [15] while the EPA algo-
rithm is explained here.

3.1.1. Edge pixels arrangement
The pixels stored in the UpperEdgePixels and LowerEdgePixels
arrays are usually not arranged due to the scanning process dis-
cussed in the edge detection algorithm. To deal with the extracted
pixels easily, these pixels should be arranged sequentially accord-
ing to their positions in the thread proles. Therefore, the Edge
Pixel Arrangement (EPA) algorithm is designed to perform this pro-
cess. This algorithm works as follows:

1. Search all pixels in the UpperEdgePixels array to nd the pixel
that has the minimum x coordinate and mark it as the rst pixel
in the array.
2. Measure all distances between the rst pixel and the remaining
pixels in the UpperEdgePixels array to nd the pixel that has the
minimum distance and mark it as the second pixel in the
UpperEdgePixels.
3. Repeat step 2 by measuring the distances between the second
pixel and all remaining pixels in the UpperEdgePixels array to
nd third pixel.
4. Repeat
step 3 to arrange all
remaining pixels
in the
UpperEdgePixels according to their minimum distances from
the previous pixel.

The result of the EPA algorithm is a list of pixels arranged
sequentially from left to right. The two lists shown in the left side
of Fig. 4 shows the extracted pixels of the upper and lower proles
after applying the EPA algorithm.

3.2. Computer vision algorithms

Six computer vision algorithms were developed to calculate the
screw thread features (18 features) and one algorithm was developed
to inspect the screw threads. Once the coordinates of the upper and
lower proles are arranged sequentially by the EPL algorithm, the
computer vision algorithms are applied to perform the measurement
and inspection processes as discussed in the following subsections.

3.2.1. Inversion Pixels Extraction
For screw thread proles, the inversion pixels are the pixels at
which the prole changes its direction as shown in Fig. 5. For
any pixel in the screw thread prole, the direction of the prole
can be calculated by subtracting the y coordinate of that pixel from
the y coordinates of both the previous and next pixels. If the two
values have the same sign (positive or negative), then the pixel is
considered an inversion pixel. The inversion pixels are useful to

calculate the crest and root lines of the screw threads; therefore,
the Inversion Pixels Extraction (IPE) algorithm has been developed
to extract all inversion pixels from the edge pixels of the upper and
lower proles. For example, the IPE algorithm extracts the inver-
sion pixels of the upper prole as follows:

1. Find the rst two successive pixels which have different y
coordinates, for example yn, yn+1.
2. Using the image coordinate system shown in Fig. 5, the initial
direction (DirInit) of the prole can be calculated between these
two pixels as follows:
If yn+1 < yn then DirInit = Up, otherwise, DirInit = Down.
3. Consider the initial direction (DirInit) is the previous direction
(DirPrev) for the next pixels, i.e., DirPrev = DirInit.

4. Loop through all remaining pixels in the UpperEdgePixels array
and do the following for each pixel. Consider i the pixel number
of the current pixel.
a. Calculate the next direction (DirNext) of the prole by com-
paring the y coordinate of the next pixel (yi+1) with the y
coordinate of the current pixel (yi) as follows:
每 If yi+1 < yi then DirNext = Up
每 Else If yi+1 > yi then DirNext = Down
每 Otherwise, skip.

b.

If DirPrev and DirNext are the same then skip, otherwise, do the
following:
每 If DirNext = Down, then mark the current pixel as crest inver-
sion pixel.

每 If DirNext = Up, then mark the current pixel as root inversion
pixel.
每 Set DirPrev = DirNext then loop to the next pixel.

The IPE algorithm uses the same procedures to extract the
inversion pixels of the lower prole with one exception in step 4.
b. For the lower prole, if DirNext = Down, then the current pixel
is marked as root inversion pixel instead of crest inversion pixel.
Similarly, if DirNext = Up, then the current pixel is marked as crest
inversion pixel instead of root inversion pixel. The two lists shown
in the right side of Fig. 4 shows the inversion pixels extracted by
the IPE algorithm for the upper and lower proles.

3.2.2. Crest and Root Pixels Extraction
The Crest and Root Pixels Extraction (CRPE) algorithm has been
developed to extract all pixels lie on the crest and root lines of the
screw thread proles. Based on the geometry of the screw thread
prole shown in Fig. 6, the crest lines are the two lines pass
through the crest inversion pixels of the upper and lower proles.

Similarly, the root lines are the two lines pass through the root
inversion pixels of the upper and lower proles.
By referring to Fig. 4, the upper right list represents the crest
and root inversion pixels of the upper prole. From this list, the
crest line of the upper prole can be dened as the line connects
between the rst crest inversion pixel (pixel 465) and the last crest
inversion pixel (pixel 3609). Similarly, the root line of the upper
prole can be dened as the line connects between the rst root
inversion pixel (pixel 931) and the last root inversion pixel (pixel
3027). Similarly, the crest and root lines of the lower proler can
be dened. Table 1 shows the extracted data for the crest and root
lines of the upper and lower proles.
Any pixel can be classied as crest/root pixel if the perpendicu-
lar distance (pd) between the pixel and the crest/root line is nearly
equal to zero, i.e. 1 > pd >  1. For example, the CRPE algorithm
extracts the crest pixels of the upper prole by calculating pd
between each pixel in the UpperEdgePixels array and the crest line
of the upper prole. All pixels satisfy the condition of 1 > pd >  1
are marked as crest pixel for the upper prole. The value of pd
can be calculated using Eq. (1):

where pd is the perpendicular distance, x1, y1 are the coordinates of
the rst pixel (p1) of the crest line and x2, y2 are the coordinates of
the last pixel (p2), x3, y3 are the coordinates of the pixel at which pd
is calculated (p3).
For Cartesian coordinates, negative values of pd means that the
pixel p3 lies to the left of the crest line (looking from the rst pixel
to the second pixel), positive values means that the pixel p3 lies to
the right of the crest line, and zero values means that the pixel p3
lies on the crest line. For the image coordinates shown in Fig. 5, the

opposite is true, i.e., negative values of pd means that the pixel p3
lies to the right of the crest line and positive values means that the
pixel p3 lies to the left.
The crest and root pixels of the upper prole can be extracted by
applying the following steps:

1. For each pixel in the upper prole, calculate pd between the
pixel and the crest line.
2. If pd < 1 and pd >  1, then mark the pixel as crest pixel.
3. For each pixel in the upper prole, calculate pd between the
pixel and the root line.
4. If pd < 1 and pd >  1, then mark the pixel as root pixel.

The crest and root pixels of the lower prole can be extracted by
the same way. Fig. 7 shows the extracted crest and root pixels for
the upper and lower proles. The number of crest pixels for the
upper and lower proles is greater than the number of root pixels
because the crest of the investigated thread (Fig. 2) is a straight
edge while the root is a curve.

3.2.3. Crest and Root Pixels Grouping
The aim of the Crest and Root Pixels Grouping (CRPG) algorithm
is to extract useful information about the screw thread from the
crest and root pixels extracted by the CRPE algorithm. This can
be done by applying the following two steps:

1. Assigning each group of successive pixels a unique group
number.
2. Extracting useful information from the identied groups.

3.2.3.1. Assigning each group of successive pixels a unique group
number. In this step, each pixel is assigned a unique group number
based on the distance between the pixel and the next pixel. As
shown in Fig. 7, the distance between each two successive pixels
in the same group will be equal to 1 pixel and should not be greater
than 1.414 (
2
). The space between each two groups of pixels is
represented by the distance between the last pixel in one group
and the rst pixel in the next group. This space will always be
greater than 2 pixels. Considering this, the CRPG algorithm can
group the crest pixels of the upper prole, for example, as follows:

p



1. Consider the rst pixel is the current pixel and assign it a group
number of 1.
2. Calculate the distance between the current pixel and the next
pixel.

Table 1
Extracted data for the crest and root lines of the upper and lower proles.

3. If the calculated distance is less than or equal to 2 pixels, then
assign the same group number to the next pixel, otherwise,
increase the group number by 1 and assign the new group num-
ber to the next pixel.
4. Move to the next pixel and consider it the current pixel.
5. Repeat steps 2每4 for all crest pixels of the upper prole.

The root pixels of the upper prole as well as the crest and root
pixels of the lower prole can be assigned a unique group number
using the same way. As shown in the last column of each list in
Fig. 7, each pixel is assigned a unique group number by this
algorithm.

3.2.3.2. Extracting useful information from the identied groups. After
assigning each pixel a unique group number, each group of succes-
sive pixels can be considered as a short line. Therefore, useful infor-
mation such as the start, the end, and the length of each short line
can be calculated from each group as shown in Fig. 8. For each
group, the coordinates of the start point are the coordinates the
rst pixel in the group. Similarly, the coordinates of the end point
are the coordinates of the last pixel in the group. The length of each
short line is the distance between the start and the end points of
each group.

3.2.4. Crest and Root Groups Classication
Based on the screw thread type, the root and crest can be clas-
sied as vertex, edge, or curve. As a result, the shape of the screw
threads can be classied into the ve groups
shown in
Figs. 9 and 10a. Based on this classication, the Crest and Root
Groups Classication (CRGC) algorithm uses the information
extracted by the CRPG algorithm to classify the crest and root of
the screw thread. By referring to Fig. 9, the CRGC algorithm can
classify the crest and root of the upper prole, for example, as
follows:

1. Assume a ank line 1 connects the end pixel of a root group
(Re) and the start pixel of the next crest group (Cs).
2. For all pixels lie between the two pixels (Re, Cs), use Eq. (1) to
calculate the minimum perpendicular distance (pdmin) and the
maximum perpendicular distance (pdmax) between each pixel
and the ank line 1.
3. For the four cases shown in Fig. 9, use the calculated values of
pdmin and pdmax to classify the crest and root shape as shown
in Table 2. It should be noticed here that the calculated values
shown in the table are based on the image coordinate system,
not Cartesian coordinate system.
4. As shown in Fig. 10, use the lengths of the crest and root groups
(Cs, Ce/Rs, Re), which were calculated by the CRPG algorithm, to
distinguish between vertex and edge shapes. If the group length
is less than 2 pixels, then classify the crest/root as vertex, other-
wise, classify the crest/root as edge.

After applying the CRGC algorithm, the crest and root of the
screw thread are classied as shown in the upper section in Fig. 11.

3.2.5. Crest and Root Data Calculation (CRDC)
After classifying the crest and root of the screw thread, the Crest
and Root Data Calculation (CRDC) algorithm is used to calculate the
main data of the screw thread. This data include the crest/root
width for straight features and the crest/root radius for curved fea-
tures. By referring to Fig. 9, the CRDC algorithm calculates the main
data of the screw thread as follows:

1. If the crest/root is classied as a vertex, the start and end pixels
will be the same and their coordinates can be extracted
from the pixel groups shown in Fig. 8. Accordingly, the coordi-
nates of the middle pixel will be the same as the rst and end
pixels.
2. If the crest/root is classied as an edge, the start and end
pixels will be different and their coordinates can be extracted

from the pixel groups shown in Fig. 8. The middle pixel is calcu-
lated as the point between the start and end pixels.
3. If the crest/root is classied as a curve, three points are required
to identify the arc. As shown in Fig. 9a, the start and end points
of the crest arc (As, Ae) can be dened as the two pixels which
produce the maximum perpendicular distances (pdmax) from
the two ank lines (1, 2). The second point of the arc can be
calculated as the middle point between the start and end pixels.

Once the three points of the arc are dened, the center and
radius of the arc can be calculated. If (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) are
the coordinates of the start, middle, and end point of the arc, respec-
tively, then the coordinates of the center point can be calculated
using Eqs. (2) and (3) and the radius can be calculated using Eq. (4):

To obtain accurate measurements, three calculations are per-
formed for three pixels in different groups, then the average of
the three calculations is taken as the major diameter. Similarly,
the minor diameter can be calculated by calculating pd between
any pixel in the root pixel groups of the upper prole and the root
line of the lower prole.

After applying the CRDC algorithm, the main data of the screw
thread is calculated as shown in the lower section in Fig. 11.

3.2.6. Screw Thread Features Calculation
The Screw Thread Features Calculation (STFC) algorithm is used
to calculate the screw thread features based on the main data
extracted by the CRDC algorithm. The main important features
are calculated as follows.

3.2.6.1. Calculation of the major and minor diameters. By referring to
Fig. 6, the major diameter can be calculated by calculating the per-
pendicular distance (pd) between any pixel in the crest pixel
groups of the upper prole and the crest line of the lower prole.

3.2.6.2. Calculation of the theoretical depth and crest truncation. By
referring to Fig. 12, the theoretical depth (h1) of the screw thread
can be calculated as follows:

1. If P1 and P2 are the two end points of the ank line 1 and P3 and
P4 are two end points of the ank line 2, then the intersection
point (P5) of the two ank lines can be calculated using Eqs. (5)
and (6).
xint  P1x  r  P2x   P1x 
yint  P1y  r  P2y   P1y 
where

xint is the x coordinate of the intersection point,
yint is the y coordinate of the intersection point,

r  P1y   P3y P4x   P3x    P1x   P3x P4y   P3y 
P2x   P1x P4y   P3y    P2y   P1y P4x   P3x

If the denominator in Eq. (7) is equal to zero, then the two lines
are parallel.

2. Similarly, the intersection points P6 and P7 can be calculated
between the two ank lines 3 and 4 and the two ank lines
2 and 3 respectively.
3. The theoretical depth (h1) can be calculated as the perpendicu-
lar distance between the point P7 and the line connecting P5 and
P6. This distance can be calculated using Eq. (1).
4. The crest truncation (h2) can be calculated as the perpendicular
distance between any pixel in the crest groups of the upper pro-
le and the line connecting P5 and P6. Eq. (1) is also used to cal-
culate this perpendicular distance.

3.2.6.3. Calculation of the pitch and effective diameter. By referring to
Fig. 12, the pitch can be calculated as the distance between P5 and
P6. The effective diameter line is dened as the line which divides
the screw thread so that the widths of the threads and the widths
of the spaces are equal on a perfect thread. According to this de-
nition, the distance h3 is equal to half of the theoretical depth, i.e.
h3 = 0.5h1. Hence, the effective diameter (Deffective) of the screw
thread can be calculated as follows:

Deffectiv e  Dmajor   2h3   h2 ;
Deffectiv e  Dmajor   20:5h1   h2 

8

where Dmajor is the major diameter, h1 is the theoretical depth, h2 is
the crest truncation.

3.2.6.4. Calculation of the axial thickness. By referring to Fig. 12, the
axial thickness (Te) is the width of the screw thread measured at
the effective line. To calculate the axial thickness, the effective
diameter line should be dened by any two end points, for exam-
ple, P8 and P9. Based on the screw thread geometry, the effective
diameter line is parallel to the line P5 P6 and far from it with a dis-
tance equal to h3. Therefore, the two end points (P8 and P9) of the
effective diameter line can be calculated as follows:

P8  x  P5  x  h3  Cosh
P8  y  P5  y  h3  Sinh
P9  x  P6  x  h3  Cosh
P9  y  P6  y  h3  Sinh

1. Use Eqs. (7)每(9) to calculate the intersection point (P10)
between the effective diameter line and the ank line 1.
2. Similarly, calculate the intersection point (P11) between the
effective diameter line and the ank line 2.
3. Calculate the axial thickness as the distance between P10 and P11.

3.2.6.5. Calculation of the other features of the screw thread. The rest
of the screw thread features can be calculated using similar ways
according to the basic geometry shown in Fig. 13. For example,
the Addendum (10) can be calculated from the upper prole as
the perpendicular distance between any pixel in the crest groups
and the effective diameter line. Similarly, the Dedendum (11) can
be calculated as the perpendicular distance between any pixel in
the root groups and the effective diameter line. Also, the actual
depth (12) can be calculated as the perpendicular distance
between any pixel on the upper prole crest groups and the root
line of the upper prole.

4. Work procedures

To perform the measurement or inspection processes, the screw
thread to be measured is set on the backlighting table then an
image is captured and saved to a BMP le using the capturing soft-
ware provided with the CCD camera. The captured image is then
opened by the MISTVision software to perform the measurement
and inspection processes as shown in the following sub-sections.

4.1. Measurement of screw threads

By referring to the main interface shown in Fig. 2, if the Auto-
matic calculation check box is checked, the measurement process
is performed automatically after opening the captured image of
the screw thread to be measured. Otherwise, the user should click
the Calculate button. The calculated features of the screw thread
appear in the Thread Measurement section. If the system is cali-
brated, as it will be discussed in Section 5, the thread features will
be calculated in millimeters or inches. Otherwise, it will be calcu-
lated in pixels. The calculated features can be saved to a text le
and it can be used as a reference data for the inspection process
as it will be discussed in the next section.

where P8x and P8y are the x and y coordinates of P8, P9x and P9y
are the x and y coordinates of P9, h3 equal to the half of the
theoretical depth, h is the angle of inclination of the line P5 P6. For
horizontal lines, h is equal to zero.
After dening the effective diameter line, the axial thickness
can be calculated as follows:

4.2. Multi measurement process

In metrology, usually one measurement is not enough to give
accurate results; therefore, the MISTVision software can store up
to ve measurements for the same screw thread in order to calcu-
late the average values of the screw thread features. These mea-
surements are stored to a list called Multi Measurement List

(MML) and each measurement can be obtained from a different
image for the same screw thread. Fig. 14 shows the MML for three
measurements obtained from three different images for the same
screw thread and the average value for each screw thread param-
eter. The MML could be saved to a le for further usage.

4.3. Inspection of the screw threads

The inspection process is performed by comparing the mea-
sured features of the screw thread to be inspected with the fea-
tures of a standard screw thread within specied tolerances. In
the main interface of the MISTVision software (Fig. 2), the Inspec-
tion section deals with this process. The inspection process is per-
formed using the following four steps:

1. Entering the features for the reference screw thread:

The standard features for the reference screw thread can be
entered to the MISTVision software by two methods. In the rst
method, the standard screw thread is measured by the vision sys-
tem and the calculated features are stored as reference values by
clicking the Set as Reference button in the Thread measurement
section. One reference screw thread could be used to check many
screw threads. In the second method, the reference values are set
manually by clicking the Manual Ref. button.

2. Selecting the screw thread features to be inspected:

button. The features to be inspected should be checked and their
allowable tolerances are assigned. Each parameter can be assigned
unique tolerance values (lower and upper). Alternatively, the same
tolerance value can be applied to all thread items by entering the
required value in the text box Value for all thread items then click-
ing the Assign button.

3. Measuring the screw thread to be inspected

The screw thread to be inspected is measured by the vision sys-
tem, then the calculated features are compared with the standard
screw thread features according to the tolerances given through
the inspection tolerance dialog box.

4. Taking an inspection decision

The inspection decision is displayed automatically in the
Inspection section (Fig. 2). The decision will be ＆＆Accepted§ if all
inspected features of the screw thread to be inspected meet the
corresponding features of the standard screw thread within the
specied tolerances. Otherwise, the decision will be ＆＆Rejected§.
The details of the comparison process can be displayed through
the Inspection Details dialog box (Fig. 16), which can be displayed
by clicking the Details button in Fig. 2.

5. System verication

This can be done through the Inspection Tolerances dialog box
shown in Fig. 15, which can be displayed by clicking the Tolerances

This section explains the calibration and the accuracy of the
employed vision system. In addition, the verication of the system
accuracy is explained.

5.1. System calibration

The units of the captured images are pixels. To calibrate the pro-
posed vision system for actual units (i.e. millimeter or inches), the
pixel size in y direction is calculated according to the major diam-
eter of the screw thread to be measured as follows:

1. The major diameter (Dmajor) of the screw thread to be measured
or inspected should be entered by the user to the MISCVision
software through the Input Data section in the main interface
(Fig. 2). Also,
the units of measurements
should be
selected from the Units combo box. If the major diameter is
specied, the system will be calibrated automatically and the

measurements will be calculated in actual units, otherwise, it
will be calculated in image pixels.
2. The MISCVision software searches the edge pixels of the upper
and lower proles for the opened image to nd the two pixels
having the minimum and maximum y coordinates (Ymin, Ymax)
then it calculates the maximum diameter of the screw thread
in y direction (Dmax) as follows:

and pixel size for thread M10 (major diameter = 10 mm).

5.2. System accuracy

5.3. System verication

The accuracy of the employed vision system can be affected by
two factors (1) the size of the measured screw thread and (2) the
size of the captured image. For the rst factor, increasing the size
of the measured screw thread increases the pixel size, i.e. decreases
the accuracy of measurement. For the second factor, increasing the
size of the captured image decreases the pixel size, i.e. increases
the accuracy of measurement and increases the processing time.
Fig. 17 shows the relationship between the size of the captured
image and both of the pixel size and the processing time for thread
type M10. From the gure, it can be seen that images with size of
4.2 Mp (2048  2048 pixels) can produce a resolution of 5 lm/pixel
for screw threads of 10 mm major diameter in a reasonable
processing time (6.6 s).

To verify the proposed vision system, an ISO metric thread plug
gage (M16 coarse) with nominal major diameter equals to 16 mm
and a pitch equals to 2 mm was measured by the proposed vision
system. The measurement process was performed three times
using the MML feature, offered by the proposed software, and
the averages of the measurements were recorded. The features of
the ISO metric thread plug gage were calculated according to its
basic geometry. Table 3 shows a comparison between the values
of the thread features for both the standard thread plug gauge
and the measured features by the developed system. The differ-
ences between the standard and measured features are listed in
lm. It can be noticed that the maximum difference between the
standard and measured values was ㊣5.4 lm.

6. Conclusions

A vision system has been utilized, as a new non-contact mea-
surement system, for measurement and inspection of various types
of screw threads. Six computer vision algorithms have been devel-
oped to analyze the captured images and perform the measure-
ment and inspection processes from the captured images. The
proposed vision system is capable of identifying most of the thread
types automatically and calculating the most common screw
thread features (18 features), which cannot be achieved by any
other measuring system. The software is capable of inspecting
screw threads based on reference values and specied tolerances
for selected features. The system has been calibrated for both
imperial and metric units and was veried by measuring a stan-
dard ISO metric thread plug gage and comparing the results with
the standard values. The results showed that the maximum differ-
ence between the standard and measured values was ㊣5.4 lm,
which provide a good accuracy.
