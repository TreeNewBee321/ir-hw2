1. Introduction
The essential variety E is the variety of 3 ¡Á 3 real matrices with two equal singular values, and 
the third one equal to zero (¦Ò1 = ¦Ò2 , ¦Ò3 = 0). It was introduced in the setting of computer vision; 
see Hartley and Zisserman (2004, ¡ì9.6). Its elements, the so-called essential matrices, have the form 
codimension 3 and degree 10 in the space of 3 ¡Á 3-matrices, dened by homogeneous cubic equations, 
T R , where T is real skew-symmetric and R is real orthogonal. The essential variety is a cone of 
that we recall in (2). The complex solutions of these cubic equations dene the complexication EC
of the essential variety. While the real essential variety is smooth, its complexication has a singular 
locus that we describe precisely in ¡ì2.
The Chow form of a codimension c projective variety X  Pn is the equation Ch( X ) of the divisor 
in the Grassmannian Gr(Pc1 , Pn ) given by those linear subspaces of dimension c  1 which meet X . 
It is a basic and classical tool that allows one to recover much geometric information about X ; for 
its main properties we refer to Gelfand et al. (1994, ¡ì4). In Agarwal et al. (2017, ¡ì4), the problem of 
computing the Chow form of the essential variety was posed, while the analogous problem for the 
fundamental variety was solved, another important variety in computer vision.
The main goal of this paper is to explicitly nd the Chow form of the essential variety. This 
provides an important tool for the problem of detecting if a set of image point correspondences 
{(x(i ) , y (i ) ) ¡Ê R2 ¡Á R2 | i = 1, . . . , m} comes from m world points in R3 and two calibrated cameras. 
It furnishes an exact solution for m = 6 and it behaves well given noisy input, as we will see in ¡ì4. 
X (i ) ¡Ô (cid:4)
Mathematically, we can consider the system of equations:
X (i ) ¡Ô (cid:3)

Here (cid:4)

knowns are two 3 ¡Á 4 matrices A , B with rotations in their left 3 ¡Á 3 blocks and m = 6 points (cid:3)
B
: 1)T ¡Ê P2 are the given image points. The un-
ized image coordinates, as explained in Hartley and Zisserman (2004, ¡ì8.5). Here ¡Ô denotes equality 
These represent calibrated cameras and world points, respectively. A calibrated camera has normal-
up to nonzero scale. From our calculation of Ch(EC ), we deduce:
Theorem 1. There exists an explicit 20 ¡Á 20 skew-symmetric matrix M(x, y ) of degree ¡Ü (6, 6) polynomi-
then M(x(i ) , y (i ) ) is rank-decient. Conversely, the variety of point correspondences (x(i ) , y (i ) ) such that 
als over Z in the coordinates of (x(i ) , y (i ) ) with the following properties. If (1) admits a complex solution 
M(x(i ) , y (i ) ) is rank-decient contains a dense open subset for which (1) admits a complex solution.

In fact, we will produce two such matrices. Both of them, along with related formulas we derive, 
are available in ancillary les accompanying the arXiv version of this paper, and we have posted 
them at http://math.berkeley.edu/~jkileel/ChowFormulas.html.
Our construction of the Chow form uses the technique of Ulrich sheaves introduced in Eisenbud 
et al. (2003b). We construct rank 2 Ulrich sheaves on the essential variety EC . For an analogous 
construction of the Chow form of K 3 surfaces, see Aprodu et al. (2012).
From the point of view of computer vision, this paper contributes a complete characterization 
for an ¡®almost-minimal¡¯ problem. Here the motivation is 3D reconstruction. Given multiple images of 
a world scene, taken by cameras in an unknown conguration, we want to estimate the camera 
conguration and a 3D model of the world scene. Algorithms for this are complex, and successful. See 
Agarwal et al. (2009) for a reconstruction from 150,000 images.
By contrast, the system (1) encodes a tiny reconstruction problem. Suppose we are given six point 
correspondences in two calibrated pictures (the right-hand sides in (1)). We wish to reconstruct both 
the two cameras and the six world points (the left-hand sides in (1)). If an exact solution exists then it 
is typically unique, modulo the natural symmetries. However, an exact solution does not always exist. 
In order for this to happen, a giant polynomial of degree 120 in the 24 variables on the right-hand 
sides has to vanish. Theorem 1 gives an explicit matrix formula for that polynomial.
The link between minimal or almost-minimal reconstructions and large-scale reconstructions is 
surprisingly strong. Algorithms for the latter use the former reconstructions repeatedly as core sub-
routines. In particular, solving the system (1) given m = 5 point pairs, instead of m = 6, is a subroutine 
in Agarwal et al. (2009). This solver is optimized in Nist¨¦r (2004). It is used to generate hypotheses 
inside random sampling consensus (RANSAC) (Fischler and Bolles, 1981) schemes for robust reconstruc-
tion from pairs of calibrated images. See Hartley and Zisserman (2004) for more vision background.

This paper is organized as follows. In ¡ì2, we prove that EC is a hyperplane section of the variety 
4,2 of 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric matrices of rank ¡Ü 2. This implies a determinantal description of EC ; see 
P X s
Proposition 7. A side result of the construction is that EC is the secant variety of its singular locus, 
which corresponds to pairs of isotropic vectors in C3 .
In ¡ì3, we construct two Ulrich sheaves on the variety of 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric matrices of rank ¡Ü 2. 
One of the constructions we propose is new to our knowledge. Both sheaves are GL(4)-equivariant, 
and they admit ¡°Pieri resolutions¡± in the sense of Sam and Weyman (2011). We carefully analyze the 
resolutions using representation theory, and in particular show that their middle differentials may be 
represented by symmetric matrices; see Propositions 16 and 19.
In ¡ì4, we combine the results of the previous sections and we construct the Chow form of the 
and allows to dene two 20 ¡Á 20 matrices in the Pl¨¹cker coordinates of Gr(P2 , P8 ) each of which 
essential variety. The construction from Eisenbud et al. (2003b) starts with our rank 2 Ulrich sheaves 
drops rank exactly when the corresponding subspace P2 meets the essential variety EC . It requires 
some technical effort to put these matrices in skew-symmetric form, and here our analysis from ¡ì3
pays off. We conclude the paper with numerical experiments demonstrating the robustness to noise 
that our matrix formulas in Theorem 1 enjoy.

2. The essential variety is a determinantal variety

2.1. Intrinsic description
Let E  R3¡Á3 be the essential variety dened by the conditions:

E := {M ¡Ê R3¡Á3 | ¦Ò1 (M ) = ¦Ò2 (M ), ¦Ò3 (M ) = 0}.

(cid:5)

(cid:6)

The polynomial equations of E are (see Faugeras and Maybank, 1990, ¡ì4) as follows:

E = {M ¡Ê R3¡Á3 | det(M ) = 0, 2(M M T )M  tr

M M T

M = 0}.

(2)

These 10 cubics minimally generate the real radical ideal (Bochnak et al., 1998, p. 85) of the 
essential variety E , and that ideal is prime. Indeed, the real radical property follows from our Proposi-
tion 2(i) and (Marshall, 2008, Theorem 12.6.1). We denote by EC the projective variety in P8
the complex solutions of (2). The essential variety EC has codimension 3 and degree 10 (see Maybank, 
C given by 
1993, Theorem 5.16). In this section, we will prove that it is isomorphic to a hyperplane section of 
4,2 of complex symmetric 4 ¡Á 4 matrices of rank ¡Ü 2. The rst step towards this is 
Proposition 2 below, and that relies on the group symmetries of EC , which we now explain.
the variety P X s
Consider R3 with the standard inner product Q , and the corresponding action of SO(3, R)
on R3 . Complexify R3 and consider C3 with the action of SO(3, C), which has universal cover 
SL(2, C). It is technically simpler to work with the action of SL(2, C). Denoting by U the irreducible 
2-dimensional representation of SL(2, C), we have the equivariant isomorphism C3 = S 2 U . Writing 
Q also for the complexication of the Euclidean product, the projective space P( S 2 U ) divides into 
two SL(2, C)-orbits, namely the isotropic quadric with equation Q (u ) = 0 and its complement. Let 
V be another complex vector space of dimension 2. The essential variety EC is embedded into the 
projective space of 3 ¡Á 3-matrices P( S 2 U  S 2 V ). Since the singular value conditions dening E are 
SO(3, R) ¡Á SO(3, R)-invariant, it follows that EC is SL(U ) ¡Á SL(V )-invariant using Drusvyatski et al.
(2016, Theorem 2.2).
The following is a new geometric description of the essential variety. From the computer vision 
application, we start with the set of real points E . However, below we see that the surface Sing(EC )

inside EC , which has no real points, ¡®determines¡¯ the algebraic geometry. Part (i) of Proposition 2 is 
proved also in Maybank (1993, Prop. 5.9).

it. The line secant variety ¦Ò2 ((cid:11)S ) consists of elements of the form M = a1b T

Proof. Denote by S the variety

¡Ê C3¡Á3 such that 
Q (ai ) = a T
i ai = Q (b i ) = b T
i b i = 0 for i = 1, 2. We compute that M M T = a1b T

tr(M M T ) = 2(b T

+ a2b T
= (b T

Hence the equations (2) of EC are satised by M . This proves that ¦Ò2 ( S )  EC . S is a surface and 
1 a2 )M . 
¦Ò2 ( S ) has dimension 5 (see Chiantini and Ciliberto, 2002, Theorem 1.3). Since ¦Ò2 ( S ) and EC are both 
of codimension 3 and EC is irreducible, the equality ¦Ò2 ( S ) = EC follows. It remains to prove (i). De-
note by [ai ] the line generated by ai . Every element a1b T
+ a2b T
Q (ai ) = Q (b i ) = 0 for i = 1, 2 can be taken by SL(U ) ¡Á SL(V ) to a scalar multiple of any other ele-
ment of the same form. This is the open orbit of the action of SL(U ) ¡Á SL(V ) on EC . The remaining 
orbits are the following:

Remark 4. The surface Sing(EC ) is more familiar with the embedding by O(1, 1), when it is the 
smooth quadric surface, doubly ruled by lines. In the embedding by O(2, 2), the two rulings are 
given by conics. These observations suggests expressing EC as a determinantal variety, as we do next 
in Proposition 5. Indeed, note that the smooth quadric surface embedded by O(2, 2) is isomorphic 
to a linear section of the second Veronese embedding of P3 , which is the variety of 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric 
matrices of rank 1.
In the following note that S 2 (U  V ) is 10-dimensional and identies as the space of symmetric 
4 ¡Á 4-matrices.
Proposition 5. The essential variety EC is isomorphic to a hyperplane section of the variety of rank ¡Ü 2 ele-
ments in P( S 2 (U  V )). Concretely, this latter variety identies as the projective variety of 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric 
matrices of rank ¡Ü 2 (see also Subsection 3.2), and the section consists of traceless 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric matrices 
of rank ¡Ü 2.
Cauchy¡¯s formula states S 2 (U  V ) = ( S 2 (U )  S 2 (V )) ¨’ (cid:16)¡Ä2 U  ¡Ä2 V
Proof. The embedding of P(U ) ¡Á P(V ) in P( S 2 (U )  S 2 (V )) is given by (u , v ) (cid:11)¡ú u 2  v 2 . Recall that 
, where dim(U  V ) = 4. Hence, 
P( S 2 (U )  S 2 (V )) is equivariantly embedded as a codimension one subspace in P( S 2 (U  V )). The 
image is the subspace of traceless elements (since that is dimension 8 and invariant), and this map 
sends u 2  v 2 (cid:11)¡ú (u  v )2 . By Proposition 2, we have shown that Sing(EC ) embeds into a hyperplane 
section of the variety of rank 1 elements in P( S 2 (U  V )). So, EC = ¦Ò2 (Sing(EC )) embeds into that 
hyperplane section of the variety of rank ¡Ü 2 elements. This last variety has degree 10 by Segre 
formula (Harris and Tu, 1984, Proposition 12 (b)). Comparing dimensions and degrees, the result 
follows. 2
Draisma et al. (2016) that the Euclidean distance degree is EDdegree(EC ) = 6. This result has been 
Remark 6. In light of the description in Proposition 5, it follows by Example 3.2 and Corollary 6.4 of 
proved also in Drusvyatski et al. (2015), where the computation of EDdegree was performed in the 
more general setting of orthogonally invariant varieties. This quantity measures the algebraic com-
plexity of nding the nearest point on E to a given noisy data point in R3¡Á3 .

The variety of rank 1 traceless 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric matrices is accordingly parametrized by k T k . Substi-
tuting (4) into the right-hand side below, a computation veries that:

This proves the second equivalence in the statement above and explains the denition of s(M ),

Our goal is to construct the Chow form of the essential variety. By the theory of Eisenbud et al.
(2003b), this can be done provided one has an Ulrich sheaf on this variety. The notions of Ulrich 
sheaf, Chow forms and the construction of Eisenbud et al. (2003b) will be explained below.
As shown in ¡ì2, the essential variety EC is a linear section of the projective variety of symmetric 
4 ¡Á 4 matrices of rank ¡Ü 2, which we denote as P X s
4,2 . If we construct an Ulrich sheaf on P X s
4,2 , then 
a quotient of this sheaf by a linear form is an Ulrich sheaf on EC provided that linear form is regular 
for the Ulrich sheaf on P X s
4,2 . We will achieve this twice, in ¡ì3.4 and ¡ì3.5.

3.1. Denition of Ulrich modules and sheaves
Denition 9. A graded module M over a polynomial ring A = C[x0 , . . . , xn ] is an Ulrich module pro-
vided:

One can use either (1) and (2), or equivalently, (1) and (2)¡¯ as the denition.
A sheaf F on a projective space Pn with support of dimension ¡Ý 1 is an Ulrich sheaf provided 
it is the sheacation of an Ulrich module. Equivalently, the module of twisted global sections M =
d¡ÊZ H 0 (Pn , F (d)) is an Ulrich module over the polynomial ring A .
Fact 10. If the support of an Ulrich sheaf F is a variety X of degree d , then ¦Â0 is a multiple of d , say rd . This 
corresponds to F being a sheaf of rank r on X .

(cid:20)

Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between Ulrich modules over A and Ulrich sheaves 
on Pn , we interchangeably speak of both. But in our constructions we focus on Ulrich modules. 
A prominent conjecture of Eisenbud et al. (2003b, p. 543) states that on any variety X in a projective 
space, there is an Ulrich sheaf whose support is X .

4 consisting of matrices of rank ¡Ü r . The ideal 
4,r the ane subvariety of X s
4,r is generated by the (r + 1) ¡Á (r + 1)-minors of the generic 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric matrix (xi j ). This 
of X s
is in fact a prime ideal, by Weyman (2003, Theorem 6.3.1). The rank subvarieties have the following

Since the varieties X s

3.3. Representations and Pieri¡¯s rule

We shall recall some basic representation theory of the general linear group GL(W ), where W
is a n-dimensional complex vector space. The irreducible representations of GL(W ) are given by 
Schur modules S ¦Ë (W ) where ¦Ë is a generalized partition: a sequence of integers ¦Ë1 ¡Ý ¦Ë2 ¡Ý ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡Ý ¦Ën . 
When ¦Ë = d, 0, . . . , 0, then S ¦Ë (W ) is the dth symmetric power S d (W ). When ¦Ë = 1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0, 
with d 1¡¯s, then S ¦Ë (W ) is the exterior wedge ¡Äd W . For all partitions ¦Ë there are isomorphisms of 
GL(W )-representations:
r = S ¦Ë+r ¡¤1 (W )
where 1 = 1, 1, . . . , 1. Here ¡Än W is the one-dimensional representation C of GL(W ) where a linear 
map ¦Õ acts by its determinant.
Denote by |¦Ë| := ¦Ë1 + ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ + ¦Ën . Assume ¦Ën , ¦Ìn ¡Ý 0. The tensor product of two Schur modules 
S ¦Ë (W )  S ¦Ì (W ) splits into irreducibles as a direct sum of Schur modules:

mined by the Littlewood¨CRichardson rule (Fulton and Harris, 1991, Appendix A). In one case, that will

3.4. The rst Ulrich sheaf

We are now ready to describe our rst Ulrich sheaf on the projective variety P X s
4,2 . We construct it 
as an Ulrich module supported on the variety X s
Consider S 3 ( E )  S 2 ( E ). By Pieri¡¯s rule this decomposes as:
4,2 . We use notation from ¡ì3.2, so E is 4-dimensional. 

S 5 ( E ) ¨’ S 4,1 ( E ) ¨’ S 3,2 ( E ).

We therefore get a GL( E )-inclusion S 3,2 ( E ) ¡ú S 3 ( E )  S 2 ( E ) unique up to nonzero scale. Since 
A 1 = S 2 ( E ) from ¡ì3.2, this extends uniquely to an A -module map:
S 3 ( E )  A ¦Á¡û S 3,2 ( E )  A (1).
This map can easily be programmed using Macaulay2 and the package PieriMaps (Sam, 2009):

R=QQ[a..d]
needsPackage "PieriMaps"
f=pieri({3,2},{2,2},R)
S=QQ[a..d,y_0..y_9]
a2=symmetricPower(2,matrix{{a..d}})
alpha=sum(10,i->contract(a2_(0,i),sub(f,S))*y_i)

We can then compute the resolution of the cokernel of ¦Á in Macaulay2. It has the form:
A 20 ¦Á¡û A (1)
60 ¡û A (2)
60 ¡û A (3)
Thus the cokernel of ¦Á is an Ulrich module by (1) and (2)¡¯ in Denition 9. An important point is 
that the res command in Macaulay2 computes differential matrices in unenlightening bases. We 
completely and intrinsically describe the GL( E )-resolution below:

Proposition 12. The cokernel of ¦Á is an Ulrich module M of rank 2 supported on the variety X s
4,2 . The resolu-
tion of M is GL( E )-equivariant and it is:

F  : S 3 ( E )  A ¦Á¡û S 3,2 ( E )  A (1)

¦Õ¡û S 3,3,1 ( E )  A (2)
¦Â¡û S 3,3,3 ( E )  A (3)

(6)

with ranks 20, 60, 60, 20, and where all differential maps are induced by Pieri¡¯s rule. The dual complex of this 
resolution is also a resolution, and these two resolutions are isomorphic up to twist. As in Sam and Weyman
(2011), we can visualize the resolution by:

0 ¡û M ¡û

¡û

¡û

¡û

¡û 0.

Proof. Since M is the cokernel of a GL( E )-map, it is GL( E )-equivariant. So, the support of M is a 
union of orbits. By Denition 9(2), M is supported in codimension 3. Since the only orbit of codi-
mension 3 is X s

as it should in agreement with Proposition 12. The dual resolution (7) of the Ulrich sheaf can then 
Littlewood complexes are exact, it would be an interesting future research topic to investigate the 
sheaf that is resolved by the ¡°universal Littlewood complex¡±.
To obtain nicer formulas for the Chow form of the essential variety EC in ¡ì4, we now prove that 
the middle map ¦Õ in the resolution (6) is symmetric, in the following appropriate sense. In general, 
 where L is a nite dimensional vector space. 
suppose that we are given a linear map W
Dualizing, we get a map W ¦ÌT¡û W
  L which in turn gives a map W  L
 . By denition, the 
map ¦Ì is symmetric if ¦Ì = ¦Í and skew-symmetric if ¦Ì = ¦Í . If ¦Ì is symmetric and ¦Ì is represented 
 with respect to dual bases of W and W
 , then that matrix is symmetric, 
as a matrix with entries in L
and analogously when ¦Ì is skew-symmetric. Note that the map ¦Ì also induces a map L ¦Ç¡ú W  W .
Fact 15. The map ¦Ì is symmetric if the image of ¦Ç is in the subspace S 2 (W )  W  W and it is skew-
symmetric if the image is in the subspace ¡Ä2W  W  W .

Proposition 16. The middle map ¦Õ in the resolution (6) is symmetric.

Proof. Consider the map ¦Õ in degree 3. It is:

S 3,2 ( E )  S 2 ( E ) ¡û S 3,3,1 ( E )

and it induces the map:

3

  (¡Ä4 E )

= S 3,2 ( E )
3 = S 3,3,3,1 ( E ).

S 3,2 ( E )  S 3,2 ( E ) ¡û S 2 ( E )

  (¡Ä4 E )
By the Littlewood¨CRichardson rule, the right representation above occurs with multiplicity 1 in the 
left side. Now one can check that S 3,3,3,1 ( E ) occurs in S 2 ( S 3,2 ( E )). This follows by Corollary 5.5 
in Carr¨¦ and Leclerc (1995) or one can use the package SchurRings (Stillman et al., 2011) in

Macaulay2:

needsPackage "SchurRings"
S = schurRing(s,4,GroupActing=>"GL")
plethysm(s_2,s_{3,2})

Due to Fact 15, we can conclude that the map ¦Õ is symmetric. 2
3.5. The second Ulrich sheaf

a second formula for Ch(EC ) in ¡ì4. Consider S 2,2,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E ). By Pieri¡¯s rule:
We construct another Ulrich sheaf on P X s
4,2 and analyze it similarly to as above. This will lead to 

S 2,2,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E )

= S 4,2,1 ( E ) ¨’ S 3,2,2 ( E ) ¨’ S 3,2,1,1 ( E ) ¨’ S 2,2,2,1 ( E ).

Thus there is a GL( E )-map, with nonzero degree 1 components unique up to scale:

S 2,2,1 ( E )  A ¦Á¡û ( S 3,2,2 ( E ) ¨’ S 3,2,1,1 ( E ) ¨’ S 2,2,2,1 ( E ))  A (1).

This map can be programmed in Macaulay2 using PieriMaps as follows:

We can then compute the resolution of coker(¦Á ) in Macaulay2. It has the form:
A 20 ¦Á¡û A (1)
60 ¡û A (2)
60 ¡û A (3)
Thus the cokernel of ¦Á is an Ulrich module, and moreover we have:

20

.

Proposition 17. The cokernel of ¦Á is an Ulrich module M of rank 2 supported on the variety X s
4,2 . The resolu-
tion of M is GL( E )-equivariant and it is:

F  : S 2,2,1 ( E )  A

¦Á¡û ( S 3,2,2 ( E ) ¨’ S 3,2,1,1 ( E ) ¨’ S 2,2,2,1 ( E ))  A (1)
¦Õ¡û ( S 4,2,2,1 ( E ) ¨’ S 3,3,2,1 ( E ) ¨’ S 3,2,2,2 ( E ))  A (2)
¦Â¡û S 4,3,2,2 ( E )  A (3)

(9)

with ranks 20, 60, 60, 20. The dual complex of this resolution is also a resolution and these two resolutions are 
isomorphic up to twist. We can visualize the resolution by:

0 ¡û M ¡û

¡û

¨’

¨’ ¡û

¨’

¨’

¡û

¡û 0.

Proof. The argument concerning the support of M is exactly as in Proposition 12.
Now we prove that the minimal free resolution of M is of the form above, differently than in 12. 
To start, note that the module S 4,2,2,1 ( E ) occurs by Pieri once in each of:

S 3,2,2 ( E )  S 2 ( E ),

S 3,2,1,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E ),

S 2,2,2,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E ).

On the other hand, it occurs in:

S 2,2,1 ( E )  S 2 ( S 2 ( E ))

= S 2,2,1 ( E )  S 4 ( E ) ¨’ S 2,2,1 ( E )  S 2,2 ( E )

only twice, as seen using Pieri¡¯s rule and the Littlewood¨CRichardson rule. Thus S 4,2,2,1 ( E ) occurs at 
least once in the degree 2 part of ker(¦Á ). Similarly we see that each of S 3,3,2,1 ( E ) and S 3,2,2,2 ( E ) oc-
curs at least once in ker(¦Á ) in degree 2. But by the Macaulay2 computation before this Proposition, 
we know that ker(¦Á ) is a module with 60 generators in degree 2. And the sum of the dimensions of 
these three representations is 60. Hence each of them occurs exactly once in ker(¦Á ) in degree 2, and 
they generate ker(¦Á ).
Now let C be the 20-dimensional vector space generating ker(¦Õ ). Since the resolution of M has 
length equal to codim(M ), the module M is Cohen¨CMacaulay and the dual of its resolution, obtained 
by applying Hom A (, ¦Ø A ) where ¦Ø A
= A (4), is again a resolution of Ext3
A (M , ¦Ø A ). Thus the map 
from C  A (3) to each of:

S 4,2,2,1 ( E )  A (2),

S 3,3,2,1 ( E )  A (2),

S 3,2,2,2 ( E )  A (2)

is nonzero. In particular C maps nontrivially to:

S 3,2,2,2 ( E )  S 2 ( E )

= S 5,2,2,2 ( E ) ¨’ S 4,3,2,2 ( E ).

Each of the right-hand side representations have dimension 20, so one of them equals C . However 
only the last one occurs in S 3,3,2,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E ), and so C = S 4,3,2,2 ( E ). We have proven that the 
GL( E )-equivariant minimal free resolution of M indeed has the form F  .
nonzero. Also, as the dual complex is a resolution, here obtained by applying Hom A (, ¦Ø A ) with 
For the statement about the dual, recall that each of the three components of ¦Á in degree 1 are 
¦Ø A = A (10), all three degree 1 components of ¦Â are nonzero. If we twist this dual resolution with 
4  A (7), the terms will be as in the original resolution. Because each of the three nonzero 
components of the map ¦Á are uniquely determined up to scale, the resolution F  and its dual are 
isomorphic up to twist. 2
Remark 18. Again the GL( E )-representations in this resolution could have been computed using the

(¡Ä4 E )

Macaulay2 package HighestWeights.

Proposition 19. The middle map ¦Õ in the resolution (9) is symmetric.

Proof. We rst show that the three ¡®diagonal¡¯ components of ¦Õ in (9) are symmetric:

S 3,2,2 ( E )  S 2 ( E )
S 3,2,1,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E )
S 2,2,2,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E )

¦Õ1¡û S 4,2,2,1 ( E )
¦Õ2¡û S 3,3,2,1 ( E )
¦Õ3¡û S 3,2,2,2 ( E ).

Twisting the third component ¦Õ3 with (¡Ä4 E
  S 2 ( E ) ¡û E
E
and so ¦Õ3 is obviously symmetric. Twisting the second map ¦Õ2 with ¡Ä4 E

2 , it identies as:

S 2,1 ( E )  S 2 ( E ) ¡û S 2,2,1 ( E ) = ( S 2,1 ( E )



 it identies as:

)  (¡Ä4 E )

2

,

which induces the map:

S 2,1 ( E )  S 2,1 ( E ) ¡û S 2 ( E )

  (¡Ä4 E )
By the Littlewood¨CRichardson rule, the left tensor product contains S 2,2,2 ( E ) with multiplicity 1. By 
Corollary 5.5 in Carr¨¦ and Leclerc (1995) or SchurRings in Macaulay2, this is in S 2 ( S 2,1 ( E )):

2 = S 2,2,2 ( E ).

needsPackage "SchurRings"
S = schurRing(s,4,GroupActing=>"GL")
plethysm(s_2,s_{2,1})

So by Fact 15, the component ¦Õ2 is symmetric. The rst map ¦Õ1 may be identied as:
  (¡Ä4 E )

S 3,2,2 ( E )  S 2 ( E ) ¡û ( S 3,2,2 ( E ))

,

which induces the map:

S 3,2,2 ( E )  S 3,2,2 ( E ) ¡û S 2 ( E )

  (¡Ä4 E )
Again by Littlewood¨CRichardson, S 4,4,4,2 ( E ) is contained with multiplicity 1 in the left side. By 
Corollary 5.5 in Carr¨¦ and Leclerc (1995) or the package SchurRings in Macaulay2, this is in 

4 = S 4,4,4,2 ( E ).

It is now convenient to tensor the resolution (9) by (¡Ä4 E



2 , and to let:

T 1 = S 1,0,0,2 ( E ),

T 2 = S 1,0,1,1 ( E ),

T 3 = S 0,0,0,1 ( E ).

must be zero, since the left tensor product does not contain S 1 ( E ) by Pieri¡¯s rule. Similarly the map

4.1. Grassmannians and Chow divisors
The Grassmannian variety Gr(c , n + 1) = Gr(Pc1 , Pn ) parametrizes the linear subspaces of dimen-
sion c  1 in Pn , i.e. the Pc1 ¡¯s in Pn . Such a linear subspace may be given as the rowspace of a 
c ¡Á (n + 1) matrix. The tuple of maximal minors of this matrix is uniquely determined by the linear 
(cid:17)1 . This denes an embedding of the Grassmannian Gr(c , n + 1) into that pro-
subspace up to scale. The number of such minors is 
. Hence we get a well-dened point in the 
projective space P
jective space, called the Pl¨¹cker embedding. Somewhat more algebraically, let W be a vector space of 
dimension n + 1 and let P(W ) be the space of lines in W through the origin. Then a linear subspace 
V of dimension c in W denes a line ¡Äc V in ¡Äc W , and so it denes a point in P(¡Äc W ) = P
Thus the Grassmannian Gr(c , W ) embeds into P(¡Äc W ).
c  1 will typically not intersect X . The set of points in the Grassmannian Gr(c , n + 1) that do have 
If X is a variety of codimension c in a projective space Pn , then a linear subspace of dimension 
nonempty intersection with X forms a divisor in Gr(c , n + 1), called the Chow divisor. This is seen by 
counting dimensions in the incidence diagram:
X ¡û X = {(x, L ) ¡Ê X ¡Á Gr(Pc1 , Pn )
In detail, the bers of the left projection are isomorphic to Gr(Pc2 , Pn1 ), so they have dimension 
(c  1)(n  c + 1). So
dim(X ) = (c  1)(n  c + 1) + (n  c ) = c (n + 1  c )  1.
Since the right arrow is degree 1 onto its image, that image has dimension dim(X ), which is 1 less 
(cid:17)1 , any hyperplane in the latter projective 
than dim(Gr(c , n + 1)). Next recall that the divisor class group of Gr(c , n + 1) is isomorphic to Z. 
Considering the Pl¨¹cker embedding Gr(c , n + 1)  P
space intersects the Grassmannian in a divisor which generates the divisor class group of Gr(c , n + 1).

Ulrich sheaves can give such formulas.

 for the vector space generated by the variables x0 , . . . , xn . Consider the 
minimal free resolution (5) of M . The map d i may be represented by a matrix D i of size ¦Âi ¡Á ¦Âi+1 , 
 . Since (5) is a complex the product of two successive matri-
with entries in the linear space W

multiplying elements in the ring A = Sym(W

Now comes the shift of view: Let B = ¨’n
¡Äi W
 be the exterior algebra on the vector space W
We now consider the entries in the D i (which are all degree one forms in A 1 = W
 = B 1 ) to be in 
the ring B instead. We then multiply together all the matrices D i corresponding to the maps d i . The 
multiplications of the entries are performed in the skew-commutative ring B . We then get a product:
D = D 0 ¡¤ D 1 ¡¤ ¡¤ ¡¤ D c1 ,
where c is the codimension of the variety X which supports F . If F has rank r and the degree of X
is d , the matrix D is a nonzero rd ¡Á rd matrix. The entries in the product D now lie in ¡Äc W
 . Now 
comes the second shift of view: We consider the entries of D to be linear forms in the polynomial 
ring Sym(¡Äc W
). Then we take the determinant of D , computed in this polynomial ring, and get 
a form of degree rd in Sym(¡Äc W

4.3. Skew-symmetry of the matrices computing the Chow form of P X s

4,2

In ¡ì3 we constructed two different Ulrich modules of rank 2 on the variety P X s
4,2 of symmetric 
4 ¡Á 4 matrices of rank ¡Ü 2. That variety has degree 10. The matrix D thus in both cases is 20 ¡Á 20, 
and its determinant is a square in Sym(¡Äc W
) as we now show. In fact, and here our analysis of 
the equivariant resolutions pays off, the matrix D in both cases is skew-symmetric when we use the 
bases distinguished by representation theory for the differential matrices:



Lemma 20. Let A , B , C be matrices of linear forms in the exterior algebra. Their products behave as follows 
under transposition:
1. ( A ¡¤ B )T =  B T ¡¤ A T
2. ( A ¡¤ B ¡¤ C )T = C T ¡¤ B T ¡¤ A T .
is because u v w = w v u for linear forms in the exterior algebra. 2
Proof. Part (1) is because u v =  v u when u and v are linear forms in the exterior algebra. Part (2) 
The resolutions (6) and (9) of our two Ulrich sheaves, have the form:
F ¦Á¡û G ¦Õ¡û G
Dualizing and twisting we get the resolution:
F ¦Â T¡û G ¦Õ T¡û G
Since ¦Õ = ¦Õ T , both ¦Â and ¦Á T map isomorphically onto the same image. We can therefore replace the 
map ¦Â in (11) with ¦Á T , and get the GL( E )-equivariant resolution:

Even though our primary aim is to compute the Chow form of the essential variety, we get ex-
plicit matrix formulas for the Chow form of P X s
4,2 as a by-product of our method. We carried out 
the computation in Proposition 21 in Macaulay2 for both Ulrich modules on P X s
4,2 . We used the 
package PieriMaps to make matrices D 1 and D 2 representing ¦Á and ¦Õ with respect to the built-in 
choice of bases parametrized by semistandard tableaux. We had to multiply D 2 on the right by a 
change of basis matrix to get a matrix representative with respect to dual bases, i.e. symmetric. For 
pairing S 3,2 ( E )  S 3,3,1 ( E ) ¡ú (¡Ä4 E )
example in the case of the rst Ulrich module (6) this change of basis matrix computes the perfect 
3 . Let us describe the transposed inverse matrix that represents 
the dual pairing. Columns are labeled by the semistandard Young tableaux S of shape (3, 2), and rows 
obtained by tting together the tableau S and the tableau T rotated by 180 into a tableau of shape 
are labeled by the semistandard Young tableaux T of shape (3, 3, 1). The ( S , T )-entry in the matrix is 
(3, 3, 3, 3), straightening, and then taking the coecient of

les or at this paper¡¯s webpage.1 Their Pfaans equal the Chow form of P X s
4,2 , which is an ele-
ment in the homogeneous coordinate of the Gr(3, 10) = Gr(P2 , P9 ). To get a feel for the ¡®size¡¯ of 
this Chow form, note that this ring is a quotient of the polynomial ring Sym(¡Ä3 Sym2 ( E )) in 120 
Pl¨¹cker variables, denoted Q[ p {11,12,13} , . . . , p {33,34,44} ] on our website, by the ideal minimally gener-
ated by 2310 Pl¨¹cker quadrics. We can compute that the degree 10 piece where Ch( P X s
4,2 ) lives is a 
108,284,013,552-dimensional vector space.
Both 20 ¡Á 20 matrices afford extremely compact formulas for this special element. Their entries are 
linear forms in p {11,12,13} , . . . , p {33,34,44} with one- and two-digit relatively prime integer coecients. 
No more than 5 of the p -variables appear in any entry. In the rst matrix, 96 off-diagonal entries 
equal 0. The matrices give new expressions for one of the two irreducible factors of a discriminant 
studied since 1879 by Salmon (1960) and as recently as 2011 (Plaumann et al., 2011), as we see next 
in Remark 22.
Remark 22. From the subject of plane curves, it is classical that every ternary quartic form f ¡Ê
C[x, y , z]4 can be written as f = det(x A + y B + zC ) for some 4 ¡Á 4 symmetric matrices A , B , C . 
Geometrically, this expresses V( f ) inside the net of plane quadrics (cid:24) A , B , C (cid:25) as the locus of singular 
quadrics. By Theorem 7.5 of Plaumann et al. (2011), that plane quartic curve V( f ) is singular if and 
only if the Vinnikov discriminant:

( A , B , C ) = M( A , B , C )P( A , B , C )

evaluates to 0. Here M is a degree (16, 16, 16) polynomial known as the tact invariant and P is 
a degree (10, 10, 10) polynomial. The factor P equals the Chow form Ch( P X s
4,2 ) after substituting 
Pl¨¹cker coordinates for Stiefel coordinates:

4.5. Explicit matrices computing the Chow form of EC

We now can put everything together and solve the problem raised by Agarwal, Lee, Sturmfels and 
Thomas in Agarwal et al. (2017) of computing the Chow form of the essential variety. In Proposition 7, 
we constructed a linear embedding s : P8 (cid:10)¡ú P9 that restricts to an embedding EC (cid:10)¡ú P X s
4,2 . Both 
4,2 pull back to Ulrich sheaves supported on EC , and their 
of our Ulrich sheaves supported on P X s
minimal free resolutions pull back to minimal free resolutions:

two Ulrich modules. So, to get the Chow form Ch(EC ) from Propositions 12 and 17, we took matrices 
 . That amounts to substituting xi j = s(M )i j , where 
D 1 and D 2 symmetrized from above, and applied s
1 , which is a product of a 20 ¡Á 60, a 60 ¡Á 60 and a 
s(M ) is from ¡ì2.2. We then multiplied D 1 D 2 D T
60 ¡Á 20 matrix, over the exterior algebra.
The two resulting explicit 20 ¡Á 20 skew-symmetric matrices are available at the paper¡¯s web-
page. Their Pfaans equal the Chow form of EC , which is an element in the homogeneous 
coordinate of Gr(P2 , P8 ). We denote that ring as the polynomial ring in 84 (dual) Pl¨¹cker 
variables Q[q{11,12,13} , . . . , q{31,32,33} ] modulo 1050 Pl¨¹cker quadrics. Here Ch(EC ) lives in the 
9,386,849,472-dimensional subspace of degree 10 elements.
Both matrices are excellent representations of Ch(EC ). Their entries are linear forms in q{11,12,13} ,
. . . , q{31,32,33} with relatively prime integer coecients less than 216 in absolute value. In the rst 
matrix, 96 off-diagonal entries vanish, and no entries have full support.
Bringing this back to computer vision, we can now prove our main result stated in ¡ì1:
Proof of Theorem 1. We rst construct M(x(i ) , y (i ) ), and then we prove that it has the desired prop-
erties. For the construction, let Z denote the 6 ¡Á 9 matrix:

where the columns of Z are labeled by 11, 12, . . . , 33 respectively. Now set q i jk to be the determinant 
above that compute the Chow form Ch(EC ). This constructs M(x(i ) , y (i ) ).
Observe that M(x(i ) , y (i ) ) drops rank if and only if the subspace ker( Z )  P8 intersects EC . This 
follows by denition of the Chow form, since the Pl¨¹cker coordinates of ker( Z ) equal the maximal 
minors of Z when Z is full-rank (Gelfand et al., 1994, p. 94). Said differently:

In the rest of the proof of Theorem 1, we relate solutions of (1) to solutions of (12). As goes

We substitute the maximal minors of Z into the matrices computing Ch(EC ) in Macaulay2. The 
determinant command then outputs 0. This computation recovers the fact that the point correspon-
dences are images of 6 world points under a pair of calibrated cameras.
Example 24. Random data {(x(i ) , y (i ) ) ¡Ê R2 ¡Á R2 | i = 1, . . . , 6} is expected to land outside the Chow 
divisor of EC . We made an instance using the random(QQ) command in Macaulay2 for each 
coordinate of image point. The coordinates ranged from 1
8 to 5 in absolute value. We carried out 
the substitution from Example 23, and got two full-rank skew-symmetric matrices with Pfaans 
¡Ö 5.5 ¡Á 1025 and ¡Ö 1.3 ¡Á 1022 , respectively. These matrices certied that the system (1) admits no 
solutions for that random input.

The following proposition is based on general properties of Chow forms, collectively known as 
the U-resultant method to solve zero-dimensional polynomial systems. In our situation, it gives a 
connection with the ¡®ve-point algorithm¡¯ for computing essential matrices. The proposition is compu-
tationally inecient as-is for that purpose, but see Murao et al. (1993) for a more ecient algorithm 
that would exploit our matrix formulas for Ch(EC ). Implementing the algorithms in Murao et al.
(1993) for our matrices is one avenue for future work.
Proposition 25. Given a generic 5-tuple {(x(i ) , y (i ) ) ¡Ê R2 ¡Á R2 | i = 1, . . . , 5}, if we make the substitution 
from the proof of Theorem 1, then the Chow form Ch(EC ) specializes to a polynomial in R[x(6)
Over C, this specialization completely splits as:

polynomials are inhomogeneous of degree 20, so they are ¡Ô. 2

point pairs will only come to the computer vision practitioner with nite accuracy. In other words, 
they differ from exact correspondences by some noise.
Question 26. While in Theorem 1 the matrix M(x, y ) drops rank when there is an exact solution to (1), how 
can we tell if there is an approximate solution?
The answer is to calculate the Singular Value Decomposition of the matrices M(x, y ) from The-
orem 1, when a noisy six-tuple of image point correspondences is plugged in. Since Singular Value 
Decomposition is numerically stable (Demmel, 1997, ¡ì5.2), we expect approximately rank-decient 
SVD¡¯s when there exists an approximate solution to (1). To summarize, since we have matrix formu-
las, we can look at spectral gaps in the presence of noise.
We offer experimental evidence that this works. For our experiments, we assumed uniform noise 
from unif [10r , 10r ]; this arises in image processing from pixelation (Bovik, 2005, ¡ì4.5). For each 
r = 1, 1.5, 2, . . . , 15, we executed ve hundred of the following trials:

respectively, with the above noisy image coordinates plugged in.

These experiments were performed in Macaulay2 using double precision for all oating-point 
arithmetic. Since it is a little subtle, we elaborate on our algorithm to pseudo-randomly generate 
exact correspondences in the rst bullet. It breaks into three steps:
1. Generate calibrated cameras A , B ¡Ê Q3¡Á4 . To do this, we sample twice from the Haar measure on 
SO(3, R) and sample twice from the uniform measure on the radius 2 ball centered at the origin 
nearby rotations, we pullback under R3 ¡ú S 3 \{N } ¡ú SO(3, R), we take nearby points in Q3 , 
in R3 . Then we concatenate nearby points in SO(3, Q) and Q3 to obtain A and B . To nd the 
and then we pushforward.
