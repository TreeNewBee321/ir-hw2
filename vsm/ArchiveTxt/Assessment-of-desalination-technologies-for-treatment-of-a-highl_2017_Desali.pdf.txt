abstract

Brine extraction is a promising strategy for the management of increased reservoir pressure, resulting from
carbon dioxide (CO2) injection in deep saline reservoirs. The extracted brines usually have high concentrations
of total dissolved solids (TDS) and various contaminants, and require proper disposal or treatment. In this article,
rst by conducting a critical review, we evaluate the applicability, limits, and advantages or challenges of various
commercially available and emerging desalination technologies that can potentially be employed to treat the
highly saline brine (with TDS values N 70.000 ppm) and those that are applicable to a ~ 200,000 ppm TDS brine
extracted from the Mt. Simon Sandstone, a potential CO2 storage site in Illinois, USA. Based on the side-by-side
comparison of technologies, evaporators are selected as the most suitable existing technology for treating Mt.
Simon brine. Process simulations are then conducted for a conceptual design for desalination of 454 m3/h
(2000 gpm) pretreated brine for near-zero liquid discharge by multi-effect evaporators. The thermal energy
demand is estimated at 246 kWh per m3 of recovered water, of which 212 kWh/m3 is required for multiple-effect
evaporation and the remainder for salt drying. The process also requires additional electrical power of
~ 2 kWh/m3.

Klapperich et al. reported that by 2050, global geologic storage of
9.12 billion metrics tons of CO2 per year will be required to meet CO2
emission reduction goals [1]. The U.S. Department of Energy has identi-
ed deep saline reservoirs as the largest potential sinks for CO2 storage
in the United States. The total CO2 storage capacity in major saline res-
ervoirs, estimated by the U.S. Department of Energy carbon sequestra-
tion partnerships, is at least 2300 billion metric tons and possibly as
high as about 22,000 billion tons [2].
Large-scale geological CO2 sequestration may result in increasing the
reservoir pressure beyond a level that is allowable by safety standards
or potential regulations. Brine extraction is considered a promising
strategy for managing increased reservoir pressure [3每5]. Signicant
volumes of brine may be extracted if geological CO2 sequestration in
deep brine reservoirs is implemented at industrial scales. Assuming
that each metric ton of injected CO2 displaces 1.25 m3 of reservoir
uid, Klapperich et al. estimate that up to 31.2 million m3 of brine

might be extracted globally each day, although extraction rates may be
limited by site-specic factors [1]. Breunig et al. estimate that 2 m3 of
brine will be extracted for every metric ton of CO2 injected, and that a
single CO2 injection site might receive 8.9 million metric tons of CO2
per year, resulting in about 48,000 m3/day of brine extraction [3]. The
extracted brines usually have high concentrations of total dissolved
solids (TDS), suspended solids, and various contaminants and require
proper disposal or treatment. Veil et al. reported the distribution of dif-
ferent water quality parameters of 34,000 brine samples collected from
basins that are considered potential targets for CO2 sequestration [6].
They found that, of 52 formations sampled, 58% of geological formation
brines had a median TDS concentration of at least 50,000 ppm, and 23%
exhibited salinities N 100.000 ppm [6].
The high-TDS extracted brine cannot be discharged to the environ-
ment or applied for benecial uses without proper treatment. The dis-
posal of extracted brine by deep well injection into other formations
might not be an option for many CO2 sequestration sites for several rea-
sons, including the availability of proper geological formations, the high
volume of extracted brine, the high cost or other challenges of brine
transportation, required pretreatments before brine injection, and envi-
ronmental regulations. Therefore, treatment of extracted high-TDS
brine might be the only practical option for some sequestration sites.
Highly concentrated salt brine efuents are also generated from a
variety of sources, including seawater desalination processes, cooling
tower blowdown, mine tailing leachate, and produced water from fossil
fuel production. The International Desalination Association reported
that, as of 2015, there were N 18.000 desalination plants worldwide,
with a total production capacity of N 86 million m3/day of fresh water
[7], about 59% of which comes from seawater desalination [8]. The
waste brine efuents from seawater desalination plants are major cur-
rent sources of high-TDS brine. For instance, the desalination of seawa-
ter by reverse osmosis (RO) produces brine concentrates that are
typically 65,000 to 85,000 ppm of TDS [9]. A simple assumption of 50%
water recovery for seawater desalination plants suggests a brine ow
rate of ~ 51 million m3/day from worldwide seawater desalination
plants. Produced water from oilelds, natural gas, and coalbed methane
also generates large quantities of high-TDS brine [10]. For example, the
produced water resulting from global oil and gas production is around
250 million barrels per day (~ 40 million m3/day) [11].
It is apparent that treatment of brines is increasingly necessary, both
for the successful implementation of CO2 sequestration and for the re-
duction of waste in other industries. High-TDS brine treatment creates
a challenge in water treatment because conventional seawater desalina-
tion methods are not designed for feed water streams higher than
50,000 ppm of TDS. In this article, we evaluate the applicability, limits,
and advantages or challenges of various desalination technologies that
can potentially be employed to treat the highly saline brine (with TDS
values N 70.000 ppm) and those that are applicable to a ~ 200,000 ppm
TDS brine extracted from the Mt. Simon Sandstone, a potential CO2 stor-
age site in Illinois, USA. We performed a side-by-side comparison of de-
salination technologies and selected multi-effect evaporation (MEE) as
the most suitable existing technology for treating Mt. Simon brine. We
performed process simulations for treatment of Mt. Simon brine for
near-zero liquid discharge (ZLD) treatment for 88% water recovery by
MEE. We performed material balance for a 454 m3/h (2000 gpm)

brine input unit and determined stream compositions, energy require-
ments, and other process specications.

2. The challenge of high-TDS brine desalination

Concentrations of major salts (e.g., salts of Na, Ca, and Mg) are signif-
icantly higher in high-TDS brines compared with those in seawater. The
high salt content of brine creates specic treatment challenges, such as
scaling, fouling, corrosion, and high energy consumption. Scaling and
fouling are common problems in desalination processes. Scales are
formed when mostly divalent (e.g., Ca, Mg, Sr) species are transformed
from soluble to insoluble forms that result from changes in solution
chemistry (e.g., pH and composition change) or process conditions
(e.g., temperature) during the desalination process. Scales and other
suspended solids may precipitate on the equipment surface or separa-
tion devices (e.g., membranes) and impede the desalination process
by reducing the heat transfer rate in thermal desalination systems or re-
ducing the mass transfer rate through membrane-based systems. Brines
extracted from potential CO2 sequestration sites may have high concen-
trations of TDS, scale-forming species, and suspended solids. As an ex-
ample, the composition of a high-TDS brine extracted from the Mt.
Simon Sandstone in Illinois, USA, is compared with typical seawater
and brackish water, which are the feed streams to conventional desali-
nation plants (Table 1).
The cumulative concentrations of scale-forming cations, mainly Ca,
Mg, and Sr, in the Mt. Simon brine are one order of magnitude higher
than those of other water samples listed in Table 1. The major divalent
anion, sulfate, can form scales with divalent cations under appropriate
precipitation conditions. Concentration of total suspended solids in the
Mt. Simon brine was measured at our laboratory according to standard
method 2540C [16] and is about 2800 ppm, which is up to two orders of
magnitude higher than typical values for seawater or brackish water. As
an example, concentrations of total suspended solids for selected sea-
water and brackish water samples is reported as 5每20 ppm [17,18]
and 24每144 ppm [19], respectively. Mt. Simon brine may require vigor-
ous pretreatments for the removal of suspended solids and scale-
forming species. The pH of sampled Mt. Simon brine is similar to other
water sources for desalination. However, we observed that upon
extended exposure to air the pH decreased to ~ 5.5 due to oxidation
reactions.
The salinity of Mt. Simon brine or similar high-TDS brines is also sig-
nicantly higher than the salinity of seawater. Therefore, Mt. Simon
brine can be more corrosive to many commonly-used metals. Special
corrosion-resistant materials, such as nickel alloys or corrosion-resistive
coating, may be needed for pumps, heat exchangers, pipes, or other
parts of the desalination systems. Existing seawater desalination pro-
cesses may need to be signicantly upgraded to be compatible with
the high-TDS brines.
Even if the technical issues associated with high-TDS brine desalina-
tion are resolved, costs may be prohibitive. In addition to higher pre-
treatment costs and capital costs for corrosion-resistant equipment,
energy costs will be much higher for high-TDS brine desalination facili-
ties than for seawater desalination. The theoretical thermodynamic
minimum energy consumption for desalination, which sets a baseline
for energy efciency, is dependent on the concentration of the feed

and product streams [20]. For seawater with 35,000 ppm of TDS at 25 ∼C
and with 50% water recovery, the minimum energy for desalination is
about 1.06 kWh/m3 [21,22]. Thiel et al. explored Gibbs free energy of
mixing (the difference in free energy between the feed and product
streams, equivalent to the least work of separation) for various feed wa-
ters and recovery ratios. They concluded that, at 50% recovery, the min-
imum work of separation for a highly saline brine of approximately
18.3 wt% NaCl is about 9 kWh/m3, almost an order of magnitude higher
than for seawater [23]. Thus, even a highly efcient high-TDS desalina-
tion process will still exhibit much higher energy costs than a low-TDS
desalination process.

3. Overview of desalination technologies and their suitability for
treatment of highly saline brine

Prevalent commercial desalination technologies are mainly
designed for seawater and brackish water (TDS of b 10.000 ppm) desa-
lination. In most cases, a highly saline brine feed does not fall within the
design parameters. We focus our discussion on brief descriptions of

different desalination processes and relevant research related to highly
saline brine treatment.
The majority of desalination plants employ RO, multiple-stage ash
(MSF), multiple-effect distillation (MED), and electrodialysis (ED).
Water desalination by RO is favored over that by MED and MSF because
of its lower energy consumption, typically 3.5 to 6.0 kWhelec/m3 for sea-
water desalination and 0.5 to 3.1 kWhelec/m3 for brackish water [8,24每
28], compared to typical reported energy consumption ranging from
10 to 28 kWhelec equiv/m3 for MSF [20,26,27,29] and from 5.5 to
20 kWhelec equiv/m3 for MED [20,26,27,29每31]. Energy requirement is
one of the leading factors in selection of desalination technologies. To
compare total energy consumption of various processes, thermal energy
consumption can be converted to the electrical equivalent by multiply-
ing an approximate electrical power generation efciency of about 30%
[20]. Water recovery for single-stage seawater RO desalination is typi-
cally 40% to 60% and is 75% to 90% for brackish water [9,32]. Despite
its commercial success, salinity limitations of RO render it impractical
for hypersaline (highly saline) water treatment. The osmotic pressure
of a solution is directly proportional to its concentration. Standard
membranes and membrane modules can handle pressures up to

1200 psi, appropriate for seawater RO and specialized membrane mod-
ules may handle pressures up to 1500 psi [5]. Aines et al. suggest that
advanced RO processes might be applied to a feed of up to
105,000 ppm of TDS with 10% water recovery [5]. In addition to the
practical pressure limits associated with RO membranes and the mod-
ule hardware, operation of the membranes at these high pressures
would result in the need to pump the feed brine to these high pressures,
increasing the energy requirement for the separation. These practical
limitations result in the feed salinity of current RO processes being lim-
ited to about 55,000 to 70,000 ppm of TDS [33,34].
One innovative technology that might be applicable to highly saline
brines is slurry precipitation and recycling RO (SPARRO), in which seed
crystals are introduced to induce solids precipitation on the seed crys-
tals instead of on the membrane. This would reduce scaling issues asso-
ciated with high-TDS feed waters, although pressure limitations might
still limit the applicability of RO to highly saline brines. The process
has been tested at a pilot scale [35].

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have in-
vestigated ED in stages to treat high-TDS water. A feed consisting of
195,000 ppm of NaCl was treated in a 10-stage ED unit to produce
water with only 240 ppm of NaCl. The exact energy requirements
were not reported, but the authors suggested that the energy consump-
tion was comparable to that of a mechanical vapor compression (MVC)
process for a 40,000 to 90,000 ppm TDS feed. They further suggested
that voltage optimization would reduce the costs by 30% to 60% [36].
They also suggested operating ED in conjunction with RO to treat highly
saline brines [37].

Saltworks advertises an advanced EDR process: the ElectroChem
stack technology with its IonFlux ion exchange membranes. The
inlet stream concentration is up to 80,000 ppm of TDS and the outlet
stream may be as high as 150,000 ppm of TDS [38]. The process may
be worth pursuing as a brine concentrator for feeds in which salinity
is double that of seawater, although crystallization or some other treat-
ment would still be required for the EDR brine. The salinity limits for this
commercial system are still too low for the Mt. Simon brine, which has a
salinity of about 200,000 ppm of TDS.
The conventional desalination processes (RO, MSF, MED, and ED/
EDR) primarily target brackish water and seawater sources, but various
emerging desalination technologies might be suitable for hypersaline
feed streams. These include forward osmosis (FO), membrane distilla-
tion (MD), humidication compression, fractional freeze crystallization
of ice, supercritical desalination processes, and antisolvent addition.
Mature, commercially available high-TDS desalination technologies
are limited to evaporators including brine concentrators and
crystallizers.
Unlike an RO process, in forward or direct osmosis, no pressure is ap-
plied to the membrane. Instead, a draw solution with a higher osmotic
pressure than the feed solution is used to draw clean water out of the sa-
line feed solution and across the membrane. Technically, FO is feasible
for highly saline solutions depending on the availability of suitable
draw solutions. Various salinity ranges have been reported, up to at
least 175,000 ppm of TDS [39]. In one laboratory study, 5 M fructose
was used as the draw solution for 1 M or 2 M NaCl (~ 58,000 to
117,000 ppm of NaCl). Water recoveries of 56.8% and 38.5% were
achieved for the 1 M and 2 M NaCl solutions, respectively. The water
ux was signicantly lower for the 2 M feed solution (4.0 L/m2/h)
than for the 1 M feed (8.2 L/m2/h) [40,41].

From an energetic standpoint, FO is a promising desalination tech-
nology, but the commercialization potential will ultimately depend on
the energy required in the draw solution recovery step. The ideal
draw solution will have to be an inexpensive, stable, and nontoxic solu-
tion with high osmotic pressure, and must be recoverable by a simple
process [42].
One promising draw solution is ammonia/carbon dioxide (NH3/
CO2). Oasys Water's Membrane Brine Concentrator uses NH3/CO2 as a
draw solution to treat wastewater in the Permian basin [43,44]. The av-
erage feed salinity is 103,000 ppm, with an average product concentra-
tion of 737 ppm and a brine by-product concentration of 241,000 ppm
[43,44]. A pilot demonstration of the technology yielded concentrate
of about 180,000 ppm of TDS when the feed solution salinity was
about 73,000 ppm. Thermal energy consumption in that case, including
NH3/CO2 draw solution regeneration, was reported to be about
275 kWhth/m3 (~ 83 kWhelec equiv/m3), with water recovery of 64% and
a rather low ux of 2.6 L/m2-h [45]. However, some authors argue
that the energy consumption of this process is too high for practical ap-
plications and that the presence of residual ammonia in the treated
water renders it unt for use as drinking water [46].
Membrane distillation is a promising emerging technology that
combines some of the features of thermal and membrane processes.
The process is based on a vapor pressure gradient across a hydrophobic
membrane. The rst MD plant (a small plant with a capacity of only
10 m3/day) for seawater desalination was commissioned by Aquaver
in February 2014 [47]. Aquaver's vacuum MD process was tested on
synthetic seawater and on samples with salinities up to 175,000 ppm
of TDS [48]. Membrane distillation may be a viable option for highly sa-
line brine desalination because, theoretically, there is no limitation on
the salinity of the feed solution and brines up to 300,000 ppm of TDS,

or near saturation, may be treated [39,49]. General Electric (GE) and
Memsys successfully operated an MD system over a 200 h test period
to concentrate a 150,000 ppm of TDS feed up to 230,000 ppm of TDS
[40]. Pilot studies by ConocoPhilips Global Water Sustainability Center,
Qatar University, and Qatar Electricity & Water Company indicate that
~ 70,000 ppm TDS brine concentrate from a thermal desalination plant
may be desalinated by multi-effect vacuum MD with 52% recovery
and a ux of 6.2 L/m2/h [50]. Many researchers, e.g. Mericq et al. [51].
and Zhang et al. [52], have reported successfully operating MD at
bench scale to concentrate wastewater or synthetic brines to near satu-
ration. Sanmartino et al. report concentrating synthetic NaCl brine to su-
persaturation [53].
Membrane distillation is especially promising when coupled with a
crystallizer. Tun and Groth investigated an integrated MD crystallization
process to treat RO brine concentrate. The initial brine concentration of
19,200 ppm TDS was increased to 212,899 ppm TDS by MD, with a ux
of 3每5 L/m2/h, which declined as the solution became more concentrat-
ed. When water recovery was about 75每80%, the MD brine was fed to a
crystallizer, which facilitates the precipitation of salt crystals. Liquid
concentrate from the crystallizer is recirculated back to the MD system,
allowing for a total water recovery of up to 95% [49].
In a humidication每dehumidication (HD) process, hot air is
brought into contact with saline water, resulting in the extraction of
water vapor from the feed solution. The humid air must then be
dehumidied by being brought into contact with a cold surface. In the
rst major variation of the HD process, condensation occurs in a heat
exchanger used to preheat the seawater. In the second variation
(dewvaporation), evaporation and condensation take place in
the same vessel [54]. Humidication每dehumidication desalination
requires a large amount of thermal energy (300 to 550 kWh/m3) but
may be a viable process when a waste heat source or renewable energy
source is available [39]. In HD processes, ltration and softening are re-
quired to prevent equipment fouling.
A dewvaporation module is commercially available through Altela,
Inc [32]. Gradiant Technology and Saltworks are examples of vendors
that use the HD process. Saltworks Technologies Inc. advertises a ther-
mally driven crystallizer based on a multiple-effect humidied air
cycle that has no limit for inlet TDS concentration [55]. Gradiant, a
startup company that resulted from HD desalination research at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advertises a carrier gas extrac-
tion process specically designed to treat highly saline brines [56每58].
In at least one case, HD was integrated with MD hypersaline brine
treatment. Minier-Mater et al. developed a pilot system to treat up to
6.3% TDS brine by MD, resulting in brine of up to 10.2% TDS which was
then fed to a pilot HD unit which reportedly functioned as a crystallizer.
The energy requirement for the MD unit was 260 kWh/m3 and the en-
ergy required by the HD unit was 220 kWh/m3, indicating that the pro-
cess seems to be technically feasible but requires improvement in
energy efciency before scaling up to treat industrial quantities [59].
Freeze每me lt desa l inat ion processes are based on the pr inc ip le
that some water impurities might be excluded during the formation
of ice crysta ls. A sa line solution is subjected to controlled freez ing
and me lt ing , wh ich can resu lt in the separat ion of pur ied water
from salts . Mult iple freeze每melt cyc les can be used . The resu lt ing
pure water crystals can be separated from the remaining pockets of
saline brine by rinsing, then melted. Advocates of freeze每melt desa-
lination cite the low latent heat of freezing (7 times lower than the
latent heat of evaporation) as an indicator of huge potential energy
sav ings compared with trad it iona l evaporat ive techno log ies , as
well as the lower scaling potential at lower temperatures [60每63] .
This emerging technology can be potentially applicable to treatment
of high-TDS brine but needs further development to address issues
related to equipment and systems for handling ice and separating
ice crystals, and correspondingly high capital costs.
Cooling crystallization of salt and multiphase turbo-expansion are
both freeze crystallization technologies. A multiphase turbo expander

is presently being developed by GE [64]. Brine is injected into a com-
pressed air stream, and the mixture is then expanded in a turbo-ex-
pander capable of handling multiple phases. Quick expansion results
in cooling and in the production of salt and ice crystals, which are
then separated. This innovative technology claims to be more energy ef-
cient (with predicted energy consumption of under 40 kWh/m3) com-
pared with thermal crystallization [64]. Further development of this
technology is required before potential application to Mt. Simon brine
treatment.
In a supercritical desalination process, the brine is brought to water
supercritical conditions (temperature N 374 ∼C, pressure N 220 bar), at
which point the solubility of the salts decreases signicantly (e.g., the
solubility of NaCl may reduce to ~ 100 ppm), and salts spontaneously
precipitate out by a shock crystallization phenomenon [65,66]. The
main advantage of this process is its suitability for treatment of high-
TDS brines. Some of the main challenges of this process include the con-
tinuous separation of salts, the requirement of special high-pressure/
high-temperature and corrosion-resistant equipment, and the high en-
ergy demand. Odu et al. developed a pilot scale supercritical water desa-
lination process designed for ZLD treatment of seawater and
determined that the energy consumption of the process to produce a
water product with 750 ppm of TDS was 450 MJth per m3 of product
water (125 kWhth/m3) [67]. Supercritical precipitation has also been
proposed by other researchers (e.g., Lean et al. [68]; Research Partner-
ship to Secure Energy for America [69]); however, only partial water re-
covery for highly saline brines by these processes (e.g., for input and
output concentrations of 200,000 and 300,000 ppm, respectively) is ex-
pected without the addition of a conventional crystallization unit. Fur-
thermore, such an approach might be energetically superior to
existing thermal evaporators with an efcient heat integration and re-
covery system or by integration with a power generation system. Re-
searchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign propose
using the supercritical steam in a cogeneration process for power pro-
duction to mitigate energy consumption of supercritical desalination
[65]. Using this approach, the input energy will be partially recovered
as the electrical power in a water每electricity cogeneration system. Con-
tinued research and development is needed to further address the chal-
lenges of supercritical water desalination.
Supercritical reactor systems have been developed for wastewater
treatment, and in some systems salt removal is accomplished by
employing a 2-zone reactor system in which salts precipitate in the
upper supercritical zone, and then fall into the lower subcritical zone
where they dissolve and are removed as liquid waste [70每72]. In this
sort of system, the primary purpose of the system is oxidation of organic
materials. The feed salinity is much lower than Mt. Simon brine; while
some salts are removed in order to prevent clogging in the system, the
process will not be effective for a highly saline feed stream. A means
to remove precipitated salts as solids, rather than as a liquid waste
stream, must be developed for the successful application of supercritical
desalination to high-TDS brines.
In the antisolvent addition process an antisolvent 每 a chemical that
reduces the solubility of the salt solutes 每 is added to the brine.
Antisolvent addition is commonly applied to precipitate salts or
organics in specialty chemical production. Zijlema et al. concluded
that, compared to evaporative crystallization, antisolvent addition
would reduce the energy consumption for NaCl production but would
result in high capital costs [73].The technology might be technically
feasible for hypersaline brine treatment, but the operation of such a
scheme at a very large scale appears to have no precedent.
Brine concentrators and crystallizers are considered as the common
available technology for management of the concentrated brine in a ZLD
system. Brine concentrators will typically concentrate a saline feed up to
about 200,000 ppm of TDS [74,75], or possibly even higher [76,77], be-
fore crystallization. Water recovery depends on feed concentration,
but is typically 90每98% [78]. Data on the feed concentration, water re-
covery, waste stream concentration, and energy consumption of

industrial brine concentrators and crystallizers is limited. Table 2 pre-
sents some of the data advertised by manufacturers or reported in the
literature for selected processes that might be used in ZLD treatment
of brines or industrial wastewater. Many sources indicate that MVC
units for seawater desalination may require only 7 to 12 kWh/m3 of
electrical power [29,79], a value much lower than indicated in Table 2.
In those cases, MVC is most likely not being used as a brine concentrator
but for seawater or brackish water desalination processes, and the con-
centrate stream probably does not approach saturation.
Spray dryers and evaporation ponds are sometimes used as the nal
step in a ZLD process. Spray dryers are considered economically practi-
cal for use only at a small scale, possibly as the nal step for a process
with a minimal waste stream remaining or for a very small scale desali-
nation facility. Capacity for spray dryers is b 10 gpm (2.3 m3/h) [83]. At
one ZLD facility in Florida, GE uses a spray dryer as the nal step in the
treatment process; the brine is sent to the spray dryer at a rate of 0.45 to
0.9 m3/h [81].
Evaporation ponds are another potential option for ZLD treatment
but they have very large land requirements, in which the area required
by the pond is determined by the evaporation rate, and the feed stream
ow rate is limited [32]. Furthermore, this technology is more suitable
for areas with dry and hot weather [84].

4. Evaluation of Mt. Simon brine treatment options

Challenging water sources, such as high-TDS produced water from
oilelds, are usually managed by disposal, and water extracted during
CO2 sequestration is expected to be handled similarly [1]. However,
freshwater generation, the recovery of salts or valuable minerals, and
the reduction of adverse effects of wastewater disposal to the environ-
ment can be some benets of pursuing high-TDS brine treatment in-
stead of disposal. Brine treatment usually includes pretreatment and
desalination stages. Commercial and emerging water treatment tech-
nologies and their potential applicability to high-TDS brine treatment,
especially brine from Mt. Simon Sandstone, are evaluated.

4.1. Brine pretreatment

Before desalination, pretreatment is required to remove contami-
nants such as suspended solids, scale-forming species, and organic im-
purities that interfere with the desalination process. Pretreatments
may be categorized as chemical treatment, physical separation, or bio-
logical treatment processes. Table 3 presents the common pretreatment
processes for produced water reported by Igunnu and Chen, Fakhru'l-
Razi et al., and Guerra et al. [10,11,85], and their relevance to Mt.
Simon brine.
The type of required pretreatment depends on the water source.
High salinity is generally associated with a high degree of water hard-
ness, so chemical treatment will most likely be required to soften
water before high-TDS desalination. Pretreatments that target hydro-
carbons are essential for oileld-produced water, but they are likely
not required for Mt. Simon brine. The brine extracted from Mt. Simon
Sandstone requires pretreatment to remove a large concentration of
suspended solids (i.e., 2800 ppm), which can be achieved by coagula-
tion每occulation每sedimentation, and media ltration. The large con-
centration of divalent metal species in Mt. Simon brine (Table 1) may
create scaling issues, and scales may be removed by chemical precipita-
tive softening using lime and soda ash.

4.2. Side-by-side comparison of desalination technologies and their poten-
tial applicability to highly saline brine treatment

An overview of desalination technologies was presented in Section
3, and energy requirements, capacity, pretreatment and the main desa-
lination requirements, maturity, capital costs, and challenges were con-
sidered. Brine concentration or crystallization technologies, as well as

other potential options (spray drying, and natural evaporation) that
are commercially available for ZLD processes are also considered. The
goal of this side-by-side comparison is to identify the technologies
that are most relevant to hypersaline brines generally, and to Mt.
Simon brine specically. Available desalination treatment options, in-
cluding commercial and emerging technologies, were evaluated and
screened for their applicability to highly saline waters. Technologies
were evaluated primarily based on salinity limitations and technical
feasibility.
The rst question addressed in Table 4 is whether a desalination
technology can treat highly saline brine with TDS of N 70.000 ppm. If
treatment of a highly saline brine is technically feasible, or if further re-
search is required to determine the salinity limitations of a process, then
other parameters are evaluated, allowing for an assessment of applica-
bility to Mt. Simon brine at the conclusion of the table.
Table 4 includes a description of process outlets: whether a technol-
ogy results in a concentrated brine or solid product, characteristics of
that brine or solid, and an estimate of the percentage of feed solution
that may typically be recovered as product water. An ideal process
would minimize the residual brine stream and maximize pure water re-
covery. The advantages and challenges of applying each process to a
high-TDS brine are also reported in Table 4. A desalination method
may be theoretically or technically feasible for high-TDS brines but
might not presently be appropriate for implementation at an industrial
scale because of other issues. These potential issues might include costs,
limited data availability, research gaps, and process complexity, among
others. Finally, an indication of process maturity and applicability to Mt.
Simon brine is provided. The maturity level varies from emerging (lab-
oratory scale or pilot scale) to commercial (industrial scale).
In general, membrane processes exhibit TDS and fouling limitations.
The high osmotic pressure of high-salinity brines is a limitation of RO
processes because available membrane materials and systems cannot
withstand the high pressures needed to overcome high osmotic pres-
sure. For FO, in addition to membrane development, identication of
an appropriate draw solution and draw solution recovery processes is
also required. Membrane distillation is an evaporative membrane pro-
cess and might be technically feasible with current membranes and
membrane modules, but might be challenging to implement at industri-
al scales unless scaling, fouling, and other technical issues are further in-
vestigated to improve ux at high feed salinity. Electrodialysis reversal
might be technically feasible, but it has not been adequately tested for
high-TDS feeds.
Brine treatment by brine concentrators is a mature technology, but it
exhibits signicantly greater energy consumption than the theoretical
minimum value, so there is space for a reduction in energy require-
ments. Current research focuses include the utilization of low-grade
heat sources and scaling-reduction techniques, and the development
of cogeneration facilities that would reduce energy consumption costs
by simultaneous power production at the desalination facility. Humidi-
cation compression is an emerging thermal brine concentration tech-
nology, and further research is required before it can be implemented
at the industrial scale. Corrosion, fouling, and scaling of equipment are
more likely with high-TDS feed solutions.
Crystallization processes might be designed to result in signicantly
less (or even no) liquid waste compared with other technologies, such
as membrane processes or evaporative concentrators, which only ac-
complish recovery of a portion of the water from the feed. As with ther-
mal brine concentration technologies, there is signicant room for
reduction in energy consumption requirements for thermal crystal-
lizers. Freeze每melt crystallization processes may require low energy
consumption, but research gaps include product water quality limita-
tions and efcient salt每ice separation techniques. Crystallization by a
supercritical desalination process appears promising, but operation at
very high temperatures and pressures can present practical design chal-
lenges. Membrane treatment of supercritical steam in the proposed in-
tegrated water desalination and power generation process may also be

98

R. Kaplan et al. / Desalination 404 (2017) 87每101

challenging. This technology needs to be tested at a pilot scale to con-
rm its performance.
According to the screening of available desalination technologies
presented in Table 4, brine desalination by commercially available
technologies is presently limited to evaporative concentration and crys-
tallization processes. These will be applicable both to concentrated
brines of approximately 70,000 to 100,000 ppm of TDS and to the
even more highly concentrated Mt. Simon brine, which exhibits a salin-
ity of ~ 200,000 ppm (Table 1). Several emerging technologies for brine
treatment, including new generation of RO, FO, MD, ED, HD, fractional
freeze crystallization of ice, and supercritical desalination, are promising
technologies with the potential for application to concentrate feed
streams with TDS of 70,000 ppm or more. For high-TDS brines, including
the Mt. Simon brine, the applicability of these processes depends on fur-
ther technology development.

5. Concep tua l des ign and process s imu la t ion for t rea tmen t of
Mt. Simon brine

Based on the side-by-side comparison of desalination technologies,
we conclude that evaporators are the most suitable existing technology
for treating Mt. Simon brine. We perform process simulations for treat-
ment of Mt. Simon brine for near-ZLD treatment to recover 88 wt% of
the water by MEE. We assume that the extracted Mt. Simon brine has
been pretreated (e.g., by coagulation, sedimentation, and ltration)
prior to the desalination stage for removal of suspended solids. We per-
form material balance for a 454 m3/h (2000 gpm) brine input unit and
determine stream compositions, energy requirements, and other
process specications. Aspen Plus (Version 8.6) software was used to
prepare a process ow diagram, simulate the evaporation and crystalli-
zation process, and perform material and energy balance. Results of the
simulation were used to estimate energy requirements for the process.
The ENRTL (Electrolyte, Non-Random Two Liquid) activity coefcient
model was selected in Aspen Plus to represent the thermodynamics of
the processes. Mt. Simon brine contains many ionic species (in addition
to those listed in Table 1) at low concentrations, and the ENRTL model
does not contain predictive solubility (and other thermodynamic) infor-
mation for all of the salt species that could possibly form. The model fo-
cused on the major species present, and those that were most prone to
precipitate during the processes. Some minor components, including
ions of Fe, Mn, Zn, Li, Sr, and Al, were not included in the simulation be-
cause they were present in the Mt. Simon brine at relatively low concen-
trations, and the complex solubility behavior of the system with these
added components would be difcult to model realistically in the soft-
ware. Fig. 1 shows a process ow diagram of the proposed system to re-
cover majority of the water (~ 88 wt%) from a pretreated brine stream. A
brief description of the main process units and operation conditions of
evaporators are also included in Fig. 1. An approximate material balance
of the system is shown in Table 5. The process uses a 6-stage MEE sys-
tem to recover water from the brine. A salt product, consisting primarily
of sodium chloride but also containing some calcium chloride, potassi-
um chloride, and calcium sulfate dihydrate is also produced.
Pretreated Mt. Simon brine, containing approximately 20 wt% TDS, is
pumped through a plate cross-exchanger (E-6100) at a ow rate of
454 m3/h, where it is preheated by water condensate streams from
the rst 5 MEE stages. The preheated feed is further heated in the rst
evaporator (EV-6001) by steam (produced by a boiler), evaporating a
portion of the water from the brine. The steam produced by the rst
evaporator is then used to provide heat to the second evaporator,
steam produced in the second evaporator is used to provide heat to
the third evaporator, and so on. The stream from the last (sixth) evapo-
rator is condensed by cooling water. The key to this process concept is to
operate the evaporators at consecutively lower pressures, so that the
boiling temperature of the brine (despite it becoming more concentrat-
ed in dissolved salts) is reduced from one evaporator to the next; the
lower boiling temperature of a second evaporator allows for the steam

from the previous evaporator to transfer heat to the second during
condensation.
The rst evaporator operates at 3.6 bar and 145 ∼C, while the sixth
evaporator (EV-6006) operates at 0.15 bar and 69 ∼C. The process ow
diagram (Fig. 1) shows the approximate temperature and pressure of
each evaporator. The steam produced in each stage (except for the
last) is condensed by evaporating brine in the next evaporator in the se-
quence; the condensed hot water is then further cooled by transferring
heat to the feed brine in E-6100. A vacuum pump (VP-6401) provides a
vacuum on the nal condenser separator drum (D-6401), which allows
for the last three evaporator stages to operate under vacuum conditions.
The rst four evaporator stages will just concentrate the brine, with-
out precipitation of salts occurring to a signicant extent. The brine
exiting the 4th stage will be at the solubility limit of salts, and salt pre-
cipitation occurs in the 5th and 6th evaporation stages. The design and
cost of the rst four and last two evaporator units are therefore different
in order to accommodate the bulk salt crystallization that occurs.
The recovered water 每 about 378 m3/h 每 is collected in a storage
tank, and pumped to users. In the evaporative crystallizers (EVC-6005,
EVC-6006) salts are precipitated as water is evaporated, resulting in
the liquid phase being a slurry of solid salt particles and brine. Evapora-
tive crystallizers are equipped with thickening/clarication sections,
such that in EVC-6005 a thickened slurry is collected from the bottom
of the vessel, while a claried brine is collected from a different part of
the vessel. The claried liquid from EVC-6005 is fed to EVC- 6006. In
EVC-6006 it is assumed that the slurry is not thickened, and instead
the entire liquid slurry product from this nal stage is combined with
the thickened slurry from EVC-6005. The combined slurry streams, con-
taining about 40 wt% solids, is cooled and ltered. The solids collected
from the lters are then dried.
There are four parallel trains of ltration and drying equipment.
Each tra in cons ists of a rotary vacuum drum  lter (F-6301 A/B/C/
D), with the wet solids dumping into a continuous rotary dryer (D-
6201 A/B/C/D). The rotary dryer uses direct contact of the wet solids
with combustion gases from burning natural gas (note that for sim-
pl icity the materia l ba lance does not show the combust ion gases
added to the dryer); extra combustion air can be added to control
temperature . The dried sol id product is dumped into b ins , whi le
the combustion gases from the dryer are sent to a baghouse to lter
out entrained solids prior to venting to the atmosphere. Salt is pro-
duced at a rate of about 60 MT/h and conta ins b 1 wt% moisture ;
the dry mass composition of the sa lt is 89% NaC l , 8 .1% CaC l2 , 2 .1%
KC l , and 0 .7% CaSO4 d ihydrate . A l l of the m inor spec ies in the Mt .
Simon brine composition could not be included in the material bal-
ance; it is l ike ly that add it iona l sma l l-concentrat ion components
(e.g., metals) will also be present in this salt, some of which might
be important in the consideration of its disposition.
The ltrate streams from F-6301 A/B/C/D are combined and stored in
a tank. This concentrated brine, at a ow rate of about 52 m3/h, contain-
ing roughly 50 wt% TDS (mostly CaCl2), is pumped from the tank for use
or disposal; as the brine cools off during storage, it is possible that some
additional CaCl2 may precipitate from solution.
When estimating the energy usage and capital cost of a process in
the early phase of design development, a number of assumptions
must often be made. These assumptions are typically based on historical
experience, information from the literature, and engineering judgment.
Key assumptions that affect the design and energy usage of this process
are listed below:

 Steam production efciency: A natural-gas-fed boiler is used to gener-
ate steam. The thermal efciency of this unit is assumed to be 80%.
 Dryer efciency: Natural gas is burned to dry the wet salt product. A
thermal efciency of 70% is assumed.
 Rotating equipment efciencies: Equipment efciencies for pumps,
blower, vacuum pump, and electric motor drives were 75%, 72%,
72%, and 98%, respectively.

99

 Other power usage: In addition to the process equipment shown in
Fig. 1, another signicant electric power load is for the cooling water
system (cooling water circulation pumps and cooling tower fans).
The cooling water system is estimated to consume over half of the
electrical power load of the process.
 Evaporator/crystallizer train differential temperature: Stage 1 (EV-601)
had a temperature difference 每 between the boiling brine and con-
densing steam 每 of 15 ∼C. The remaining stages were assumed to
have temperature differences of about 6 ∼C (ranged from 5 to 7 ∼C).
 Feed Preheater (E-6100) differential temperature: Although this ex-
changer is envisioned to be a single multi-feed plate and frame ex-
changer, for simplicity of analysis it was modeled as sequential
countercurrent exchangers, with logarithmic mean temperature dif-
ference (LMTD) of approximately 10 ∼C.
 Final condenser (E-6401) differential temperature: LMTD = 20 ∼C.
 Slurry cooler (E-6301) differential temperature: LMTD = 26 ∼C.

One issue not addressed directly in this design is hydrogen sulde.
During the distillation process hydrogen sulde is formed in the brine
from soluble sulde salts, and a portion of the H2S is stripped into the
vapor (steam) phase. As a result water recovered from each MEE stage
is predicted to contain some H2S, with the combined recovered water
stream containing roughly 205 ppmw of H2S, unless measures are
taken to prevent it. The H2S in the steam can be removed prior to
condensing by scrubbing with hot caustic in a packed tower. Another
option is to chemically convert H2S to a non-volatile product that
could be used to prevent the H2S problem, including the use of iron
redox chemistry to convert the sulde to sulfur, and other oxidation
chemistries.
Results of the energy balance, obtained from the process simulation,
are used to determine the energy requirement of the desalination pro-
cess. The two energy requirements are electrical power and natural
gas fuel. The process equipment with the largest power requirements
include the rotary salt dryers, the vacuum pump on the nal stage crys-
tallizer, the process pumps, the cooling tower system (cooling water
pumps, fans), and salt product lters. Total power requirement for the
process systems is 718 kWelec (~ 2 kWh per m3 of recovered water).
The electrical power requirement of the salt drying equipment is
about 10% of the total power requirement.
The largest overall energy source required for the process is natural
gas to provide heat for evaporation of water from the brine. It was as-
sumed that steam would be fed to the rst evaporation stage, and this
steam would be generated by a package boiler which would use the
burning of natural gas as a heat source. Another major use of natural
gas is in the salt product dryers; natural gas is burned and fed directly
to the rotary dryers, which results in the evaporation of water from
the salt. The total natural gas requirement for the process is about
92.8 MW thermal. Since water is recovered at 378 m3/h, the total ther-
mal energy usage is 246 kWh per m3 of recovered water, in which 86%
of the thermal energy is required for evaporators and the remaining 14%
is needed for drying the salt product. Without salt drying the thermal
energy demand of the process is about 212 kWh/m3 water product.
The most important factor that causes the energy usage for recover-
ing water from this brine via evaporative techniques to be signicantly
greater than that normally seen when recovering water from brackish
or seawater is the high total salt concentration. The boiling temperature
of brines generally increases with increasing salt concentration. There-
fore, in order to maintain a temperature driving force for heat transfer,
the pressure difference between the evaporation and the condensing
sides of the evaporator typically must increase with increasing salt con-
tent. That factor results in the energy efciency of water evaporation
processes being lower as they treat higher concentration brines.
The energy usage estimated by our process simulation is similar to
the value reported by Thiel et al.. [23]. Thiel et al. estimated the thermal
energy consumption for a 3-stage MED brine concentration process to

be about 250 kWh/m3. The process modeled by Thiel et al. assumed a
brine outlet concentration of 26 wt% TDS and does not account for the
solids drying steps that our process includes. Other values reported in
the literature (see Table 2) are based on MVC technology, which is
more energy-efcient but has lower capacity limitations than MEE.

6. Conclusions

Potential utilization of the Mt. Simon Sandstone as a storage site for
CO2 sequestration is likely to involve the extraction of large quantities of
highly saline brine, which will require management by disposal or treat-
ment. Desalination of the Mt. Simon brine could potentially reduce ad-
verse environmental impacts of brine disposal while simultaneously
increasing fresh water supplies. Solutions for treatment of Mt. Simon
brine can also be useful for handling other highly saline brines generat-
ed from other sources such as produced water from oil and gas industry
or concentrated brine from seawater desalination plants. Through a crit-
ical review, we evaluated the applicability, limits, and advantages or
challenges of various commercially available and emerging desalination
technologies that can potentially be employed to treat the highly saline
brine (with TDS values N 70.000 ppm) and those that are applicable to a
~ 200,000 ppm TDS brine extracted from the Mt. Simon Sandstone. The
most promising emerging technologies include ED, FO, MD, HD, super-
critical desalination, and freeze-melt technologies that after further de-
velopment can potentially be used for treatment of high-TDS water.
Among these, MD and HD have been tested with pilot scale studies indi-
cating technical feasibility for hypersaline brine desalination. At the lab-
oratory and pilot scale, MD and HD allow for the feed stream to be
concentrated near to the saturation point, and HD may even allow for
the crystallization of salts. Forward osmosis has not yet been demon-
strated to concentrate brine beyond ~ 200,000 ppm of TDS, but if mem-
branes, membrane modules, draw solutions, and draw solution
recovery methods are further developed, it is possible that FO may be
applied to higher salinity feeds. Supercritical desalination and freeze-
melt processes are both promising because energy requirements may
be signicantly lower than other technologies, but better separation
methods for removing crystals from liquid are required for both of
these induced phase change approaches to desalination. Supercritical
desalination has the advantage of producing purer products than
freeze-melt desalination. Additionally, supercritical desalination pro-
cesses may be rendered highly energy efcient by integration with a
power plant. Continued tracking of the development of all of these tech-
nologies is recommended.
Our literature review and technology assessment also revealed that,
among commercially available technologies, options are limited to
thermal evaporators and crystallizers. We used Aspen Plus software
to simulate a process in which 454 m3/h of Mt. Simon brine containing
~ 200,000 ppm of dissolved salts was treated by the MEE process in a
near-ZLD system. Pretreated brine is fed to a 6-stage MEE process,
with crystallization occurring in the nal two stages. About 378 m3/h
of water is recovered, and the remaining salt sludge is treated by ltra-
tion and drying. Energy balance indicates that the thermal energy con-
sumption for the process is extremely high, mostly due to the high
energy required for the evaporation of highly saline brine.
From our conceptua l design and Aspen simulat ion resu lts , the
near-ZLD process is estimated to consume roughly 246 kWhth and
2 kWhelec per m3 of recovered water. Without drying of the salt prod-
uc t , MEE evaporat ion alone requires 212 kWh th/m3 . This demon-
strates a huge potentia l for reduct ion in energy consumption ,
further conrm ing our recommendat ion to cont inue pursu ing
emerging technologies . The energy demand of currently available
technologies is so high that Mt. Simon brine treatment by these tech-
nologies may not be economically feasible. Emerging technologies
have the potential to signicantly reduce desalination costs by low-
ering the energy demand.
