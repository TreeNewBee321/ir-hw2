abstract

This paper is concerned with the Tobit Kalman ltering problem for a class of discrete time-varying sys- 
tems with both censored and fading measurements. The censored measurements are described by the 
Tobit measurement model and the fading measurements are characterized by the L th-order Rice fading 
channel model capable of accounting for not only the packet dropout but also the communication phe- 
nomenon. The measurement fading occurs in a random way where the fading probabilities are regulated 
by a set of mutually independent Gaussian random variables. By resorting to the state augmentation tech- 
nique and the orthogonality projection principle, the Tobit Kalman lter (TKF) is designed in the pres- 
ence of fading measurements. In the course of lter design, several state-augmentation-induced terms 
are introduced, all of which can be calculated recursively or off-line. A numerical example concerning 
the estimation of ballistic roll rates is provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed lter.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Motivation 

The past decades have witnessed the widespread applications 
of the ltering techniques in areas such as maneuvering target 
tracking, inertial navigation, global position system (GPS) posi- 
tioning, and so forth [1¨C7] . Among a variety of lters designed 
under different circumstances, the Kalman lter (KF) has proven 
to be the most popular one. It is generally recognized that the KF 
is optimal in the sense of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) 
under the assumption that the systems are linear and the noises 
are Gaussian. This assumption is, unfortunately, not always true 
in practice due to the fact that the nonlinearity, which serves as 
an important factor contributing to the complexities of the system 
modeling, exists in almost all the practical systems. In networked 
control systems, a typical kind of nonlinearities (e.g. censoring, 
fading, quantization and saturation) are unavoidable in the system

measurements due mainly to the sudden environment changes, 
intermittent transmission congestions, random failures and repairs 
of components. In particular, censored and fading measurements 
are arguably two of the most frequently encountered measurement 
nonlinearities in engineering practice. The measurement nonlin- 
earities, if not properly handled, could cause severe performance 
degradation of the traditional KF. To deal with this issue, many 
alternative ltering schemes have been reported, e.g., the extended 
Kalman ltering (EKF) [8] the unscented Kalman ltering (UKF) 
approaches [9,10] , and the Tobit Kalman ltering method [11] . 
Investigating the literature concerning censored measurements, 
fading measurements and Kalman ltering, we can nd that: (1) 
the TKF has gained increasing research attention due primarily to 
its capability of suitably processing censored measurements as well 
as its recursive/concise structure; (2) in networked systems, the 
channel fading modeled as fading/degrading measurements in both 
the amplitude and the phase is unavoidable because of the mul- 
tipath propagation/shadowing caused by the hinder of obstacles; 
(3) the L th-order Rice fading model, as compared with the ana- 
log erasure channel model and the Rayleigh channel model, has 
a conciser yet simpler structure and is suitable for simultaneously 
representing the channel fadings, packet dropouts and communica- 
tion delays. As such, a seemingly natural question is that, when the 
measurement transmission is subject to both censoring and fading, 
can we design a lter to achieve the optimal estimate of the sys- 
tem? Nevertheless, this appears to be a non-trivial question for the

following two reasons: (1) it is unclear which method should be 
chosen to deal with the time-delays coupled in the L th-order Rice 
fading model; (2) it is pretty hard to establish a modied Tobit 
regression model which can not only correctly handle the time- 
delay and fading phenomena but also help design the subsequent 
lter design in a recursive form. This motivates us to conduct the 
present research. 

1.2. Contribution 

In this paper, we consider the Tobit Kalman ltering problem 
with both censored and fading measurements. Due to the existence 
of time delays in the fading measurements, the system is rst aug- 
mented in order to eliminate the effect of time delays. Then, the 
Tobit regression model in [11] is modied by taking into account 
the fading of the measurements. Based on the modied model and 
the augmented system, a modied optimal lter in the minimum 
mean-squared error sense (MMSE) is designed with its lter pa- 
rameters explicitly characterized by the fading coecients. Finally, 
the lter for the original system is obtained from the obtained 
modied optimal lter via some matrix manipulations. 
The main contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows: 
(i) to the best of the authors¡¯ knowledge, the effort made in this paper 
represents one of the rst few attempts to deal with the ltering prob- 
lem of linear discrete time-varying systems with both censored and 
fading measurements (which are two important types of measurement 
nonlinearities in networked control systems); (ii) compared with the 
TKF initiated in [11] , several new terms arise in the lter design which 
are an expected reection of the consideration of the fading measure- 
ments; and (iii) the lter presented here is of a recursive nature and 
is suitable for online applications. 

1.3. Related work 

Censored measurements arise prevalently in a variety of appli- 
cations such as biological modeling [12] , economics [13¨C15] , com- 
puter vision tracking [16] and distributed detection [17,18] . The oc- 
currence of the censored measurements is mainly due to the fact 
that the measurements from sensors are often saturated as a result 
of dynamic changes or interferences [19] . Although receiving lit- 
tle attention in the ltering eld, the regression of censored mea- 
surements has been extensively studied in the elds of reliability 
and econometrics. The Tobit model for censored measurements has 
been put forward by economist James Tobin in 1958 for accurately 
modeling household expenditure [15] . In [15] , censored measure- 
ments taking the form of saturations, limits of detection and the 
occlusion regions are known as Tobit type 1 censoring, which can 
be described as a piecewise-linear transform of the output variable 
with a zero slope in the censored region. 
The Tobit model has been intensively investigated in eco- 
nomics, but the corresponding Kalman ltering problem has not 
drawn much research attention until recently. The main dicult 
for designing a Kalman lter for censored measurements is that 
the measurement noise is non-Gaussian near the censoring region. 
Hence, the adoption of the standard Kalman lter will result in a 
biased state estimate due to the assumption that the measurement 
noise is zero mean Gaussian. To solve this problem, great attempts 
have been made in the literature, see [11,20] and the references 
therein. In [21] , the KF was rst adopted to handle censored mea- 
surements modeled by the Tobit measurement model, where the 
censored measurements were assumed to be independent of the 
true states and thus measurements in the censored region were 
regarded as missing. Nevertheless, it is often the case that the cen- 
sored measurements described by the Tobit measurement depend 
heavily on the true states [11,22] , and simply treating the censored 

measurements as missing ones may result in biased estimates. In 
[23] , the censored and uncensored measurements were tackled 
separately using the iterative maximum likelihood method and 
all the past measurements were required in the algorithm imple- 
mentation. In [11] , the so-called Tobit Kalman lter (TKF) was, for 
the rst time, developed to track the target states using censored 
measurements and the developed TKF was further applied to the 
case of two-side censoring [24] . In [19] , the TKF was applied to 
the positioning of mobile vehicles via signals received from a 
number of antennas. In [22] , the performance of the TKF was 
compared with those of EKF and UKF, and it was demonstrated 
that the TKF achieves more reliable and accurate state estimates 
for systems with censored measurements. In [20] , the TKF with 
time-correlated multiplicative measurement noise was designed. 
On another research frontier, with the rapid development of the 
wireless communication technology, sensors are more inclined to 
be connected via wireless or shared links, and the resulting net- 
worked systems has therefore attracted an ever-increasing research 
interest. A lot of work has been done on the networked-induced 
phenomena, e.g., packet dropouts, time delays, sensor saturations 
and quantization effects. However, the channel fading, as one of 
the most important networked-induced phenomena, has received 
relatively less attention despite its signicant importance in wire- 
less communications [25] . Generally speaking, when signals travel 
along the wireless links, they are susceptible to reection, refrac- 
tion and diffraction which are caused by the obstacles that hinder 
the propagation of the signals. In this case, signals are subject to 
the multiple paths phenomenon [26,27] leading to the occurrence 
of fading signals. Many models have been established to describe 
the signal variation in both the amplitude and phase in the chan- 
nel fading phenomenon, for instance, the analog erasure channel 
model, the Rayleigh channel model and the L th-order Rice fad- 
ing channel model [28,29] . Based on these models, the problems 
of lter/controller design, stability analysis, simulator and emula- 
tor synthesis have been investigated in the literature. 
In the past few years, a number of lter design approaches 
have been proposed for systems with fading measurements, see 
e.g. Kalman ltering [30] , H ¡Þ
 ltering [31,32] and fuzzy lter- 
ing [33] . In [34] , the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem 
over multiple erasure channels was studied. In [30] and [35] , the 
nite-horizon H ¡Þ
 control for discrete time-varying nonlinear sys- 
tems and the H ¡Þ
 output feedback-control for discrete-time fuzzy 
systems were, respectively, solved by adopting the L th-order Rice 
fading model. The mean-squared stabilization problem for sys- 
tems with various kinds of fading channel models was compre- 
hensively investigated in [36] and [37] . For discrete-time multiple- 
input multiple-output systems, the problems of emulator design 
and simulator modeling over Rayleigh fading channels were tack- 
led in [38] and [39] , respectively. It should be noted that the L 
th-order Rice fading model gives an intuitive description of differ- 
ent networked-induced phenomena including the channel fading, 
packet dropout and communication delay. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , the 
problem under consideration is formulated. In Section 3 , the To- 
bit regression model is modied, based on which the optimal TKF 
with fading measurements is designed. In Section 4 , a numeri- 
cal example about estimating the ballistic roll rates is provided to 
show the usefulness of our lter, and some conclusions are drawn 
in Section 5 .

Remark 1. As is well known, network-induced phenomena 
(e.g. communication delays, packet dropouts, quantization effects, 
sensor saturations) are ubiquitous due to the widespread appli- 
cations of the networked control systems. However, the channel 
fading caused by the multipath propagation of the signal has not 
been given full consideration despite its practical signicance in 
networked communications. To deal with the measurement fad- 
ing, models such as the analog erasure channel model, the Rayleigh 

channel model and the L th-order Rice fading channel model have 
been established [36] . It is worth mentioning that the L th-order 
Rice fading model given by (2) is one of the most frequently used 
ones in areas of signal processing and remote control. With such a 
model, a few phenomenon of imperfect transmission including the 
channel fading and the time delay could be easily incorporated. As 
such, the L th-order Rice fading model is adopted in this paper for 
the lter design. 

Remark 2. The KF has become widely used in tracking and esti- 
mation. The KF is optimal in the sense of minimum mean-squared 
error when the systems are linear and the noises are Gaussian. 
However, in many estimation application areas, sensors are subject 
to a specic type of measurement nonlinearities called censoring 
or censored measurements because of saturated sensors, limited 
detection effects and image frame effects. In this case, the direct 
use of the KF would probably result in biased estimates because 
(1) the measurement noise is correlated with the state value in 
the censored region; and (2) the measurement noise distribution 
becomes censored Gaussian (instead of Gaussian), which violates 
the assumption of the Gaussian noise in the KF. Therefore, the KF 
should be modied to cater for the censored measurements. In ad- 
dition, it is worth pointing out that, as two important forms of 
measurement nonlinearities, the censored measurements and fad- 
ing measurements have not been considered simultaneously in the 
framework of the KF, and our main motivation is to shorten such 
a gap. 

Remark 3. As described in (5) , the random variables 
(m 
)
1 
 are utilized to characterize the censoring phenom- 
ena of y 
(m 
)
 . According to (4) , if no censoring oc- 
(y 
)
curs for y 
 i.e., 
 the measurement output is y 
which implies that the output measurement is the same as the la- 
tent measurement. If the censoring phenomena occur for y 
 i.e., 
 the measurement output is y 
 which implies that 
the threshold is assigned to the output measurement. Here, the 
censoring probabilities ¦Ã m 
(m 
)
 are assumed to be 
known a priori via some statistical experiments. Alternatively, ¦Ã m 
can also approximated by (see [11] ):

Remark 4. Nowadays, because of the advanced microprocessor 
technology and the fact that microprocessors can provide greater 
accuracy and computing power than analog computers, digital l- 
tering methods have been more widely utilized than the classi- 
cal analog ltering methods. This means that for modern lter- 
ing applications, the discrete-time lter would be more preferable. 
However, a thorough study of optimal ltering must include the 
continuous-time lter. Therefore, parallel to the discrete-time sys- 
tem (1)¨C(2) and (4), the continuous-time system is formulated as

ing to design a continuous-time TKF to cope with censored and

censoring and fading phenomena on the design of the lter in the 
near future.

The objective of this paper is to design the optimal TKF for 
the discrete time-varying system (1) ¨C(4) with censored and fading 
measurements. 

3. Main results 

In this section, we aim to establish a unied framework to solve 
the addressed Tobit Kalman ltering problem in the simultaneous 
presence of censored and fading measurements. The lter design 
procedure is along the similar line in [11] with two main differ- 
ences: (1) a modied Tobit regression model resulting from the 
fading measurements; and (2) additional computations of the gain 
matrix and the covariance matrix, where the additional computa- 
tions include the augmentation of the delayed states, calculations 
with respect to the augmented state and calculation of the ex- 
pected values of the channel coecients.

Thorough the above augmentation, the system with time delays in 
(1) ¨C(4) is transformed into the one in (7) ¨C(10) without time de- 
lays. 

Remark 5. In fact, many ecient approaches have been presented 
in the literature concerning the time delay phenomenon in the 
past two decades, such as the augmentation technique [41,42] , the 
bounding technique [43] , the descriptor system method [44] , the 
slack matrix variables technique [45] and the delay-fractioning ap- 
proach [46] . Generally speaking, the conservatism and complexity 
of the algorithm should be considered when handling the time 
delay phenomenon. That is to say, there should be a trade-off be- 
tween the conservatism and the complexity of the proposed algo- 
rithm. Here, the conservatism means that the proposed algorithm 
should provide a maximal allowable delay; and the complexity 
means that the algorithm includes as few decision variables as 
possible while achieving the same maximal allowable delay. In 
this paper, to remove the time delay effect, the augmentation 
technique as shown in (7) ¨C (10) is chosen to benet the following 
lter design at the cost of some extra computational cost.

Remark 6. Equations (11) ¨C(12) in Lemma 1 give the expressions of 
the mathematic expectation and variance of the censored and fad- 
ing measurement y 
. Compared with the expectation and variance 
expressions in [11] where only the censoring phenomenon is con- 
sidered, it can be observed that, due to the introduction of the fad- 
ing measurements, the term 
C 
x 
(in the case that y k 
is a 
vector instead of a scalar) in [11] is replaced by the term 
which 
characterizes the effect of the fading measurements. If the fading 
phenomenon is not taken into account, (2) becomes y 
. 
Then, the term 
reduces to 
C 
x 
 resulting in the degra- 
dation of (11) and (12) to (8) and (11) in [11] , respectively.

Remark 7. Using (11) ¨C(16) , the Tobit model in [11] with only cen- 
sored measurements has been extended to the one subjecting to 
both censored and fading measurements as shown in (4) . Note that 
the extra fading measurements result in (1) the replacement of 
C 
x 
by 
in all the equations relative to the measure- 
ment y 
; and (2) several new terms that further complicate the 
lter design.

Remark 8. Comparing the TKF in [11] with the established lter 
in Theorem 1 , there are two main differences. The rst difference 
is that the term C k 
in [11] (which is the product of the 
measurement matrix C k 
and the one-step state prediction  x k 
) 
 ¦Î
is replaced by a new term  
which is now the 
product of the mean of the channel coecient, the augmented 
measurement matrix and the predicted value of the augmented 
state. The second difference is the appearance of 
in the cal- 
culations of  y k 
and K k 
. The rst difference is caused by the 
time-delay effect while the second difference stems from the 
fading channel phenomenon.

Proof. Noticing the relationship between system (1) ¨C(4) and sys- 
tem (7) ¨C(10) , we can easily obtain the result in Theorem 2 on the 
basis of Theorem 1 . 

(cid:2)

Combing Lemma 1 and Theorems 1 ¨C2 , we have accomplished 
the design of the optimal TKF with both censored measurements 
and fading measurements. Table 1 demonstrates the implementa- 
tion procedure of the proposed ltering algorithm. 

Remark 9. According to Lemma 1 and Theorems 1 ¨C2 , a recursive 
ltering scheme is established to solve the novel ltering prob- 
lem for the discrete time-varying systems suffering simultaneously 
from censored measurements and fading measurements. System 
(1) ¨C(4) under consideration is comprehensive that covers two im- 
portant measurement nonlinearities, i.e., censored and fading mea- 
surements, which are often encountered in engineering applica- 
tions including target tracking and networked control. The two 
measurement nonlinearities are dealt with in a unied yet effective 
framework. Compared with the work in [11] , several new terms 
have emerged in the lter design and these terms explicitly reect 
the effect of the fading channel phenomenon. To be specic, the 
term 
in Lemma 1 and the term 
in Theorem 1 character- 

¦È m,¦Á

ize the effect of the channel fading. The term 
terms

in Theorem 1 and the term

Theorem 1 characterize the effects of both the time-delay and the

Remark 10. It can be seen from Lemma 1 and Theorems 1 ¨C2 that 
when implementing the presented Tobit Kalman ltering algorithm 
with fading measurements, the computation complexity mainly in- 
volves the matrix multiplication and the matrix inversion. In the

 needs to be calculated, where n x is 
the dimension of the system state;

¡Á n y needs to be calculated, where n y is the dimen- 
mensions n y

has the computational complexity of O [(n x

erally, we have 
more computation burden than the Tobit Kalman ltering algo- 
rithm in [11] which has the computational complexity of O [(n x

den in our algorithm is caused by the fading measurements.

simulation shows a robust tracking ability with a known model 
and unknown disturbance that enters the system through

surements which is named TKF-FM. Fig. 2 shows the comparison 
of the RMSE curves between the TKF and the TKF-FM after 10 0 0 
times of Monte Carlo simulations. From Fig. 1 we can observe that, 
when the measurements are subject to both censoring and fading, 
our proposed TKF-FM is able to track the true values of the system 
states while the TKF leads to signicant deviations from the true 
state values. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the RMSE of our TKF- 
FM is always smaller than that of the TKF, which is simply due to 
the fact that the fading measurements are properly handled in our 
TKF-FM while they are not addressed in the TKF.

The performance comparison between the Tobit Kalman l- 
ter (TKF) and the proposed Tobit Kalman lter with fading mea- 
surements (TKF-FM) has been made in RMSE after 10 0 0 times of 
Monte Carlo simulations. Fig. 3 illustrates the RMSE curves ob- 
tained by the two algorithms. Form Fig. 3 we nd that the RMSE 
of our TKF-FM is always smaller than that of TKF, which indicates 
the superiority of the proposed ltering algorithm in handling cen- 
sored and fading measurements. This is because that our TKF-FM 
is capable of tackling the censoring and channel fading phenomena 
at the same time, while the TKF can not deal with fading measure- 
ments.

Theoretically, as time goes on, the RMSE of the TKF in 
Fig. 3 should degrade to a certain value beyond zero because that 
the TKF is unable to cope with the fading measurements. As to our 
TKF-FM, the RMSE should degrade to zero with the increase of k 
since the proposed TKF-FM can properly deal with the fading phe- 
nomenon. Nevertheless, this is often not true due to the fact that 
part of the measurement information is lost because of the fad- 
ing phenomenon, which makes it dicult to recover the true state 
from the obtained fading measurements. This results in the situ- 
ation that there is a small deviation between the obtained state 
estimate and the true state, and hence the RMSE of our TKF-FM in 
Fig. 3 can not degrade to zero as time goes on. goes on. 

5. Conclusion 

In this paper, we have investigated the recursive ltering prob- 
lem for discrete time-varying systems in the coexistence of two 
important measurement nonlinearities, namely, censored and fad- 
ing measurements. The fading measurements have been addressed 
under the assumption that the fading coecients obey Gaussian 
distributions. The Gaussian distributions can be changed to other 
distributions, e.g., the uniform distribution on the interval [ 
, 
] 
¡Ü 1. The adopted L th-order Rice fading model 
where 0 
not only covers the channel fading but also the time delay phe- 
nomena. The two phenomena have been carefully handled by in- 
troducing the expected values of the channel coecients and the 
augmented states in the lter design, which have led to additional 
computations in the calculations of the lter gain matrix and the 
estimation error covariance. Fortunately, these additional compu- 
tations are recursive or can be performed off-line. Accordingly, the 
designed lter is suitable for online applications. Finally, the effec- 
tiveness of the proposed lter has been illustrated by a numerical 
example.
