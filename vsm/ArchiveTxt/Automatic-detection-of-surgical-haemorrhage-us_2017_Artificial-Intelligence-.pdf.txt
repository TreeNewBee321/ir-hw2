abstract

Background and objectives: On occasions, a surgical intervention can be associated with serious, poten-
tially life-threatening complications. One of these complications is a haemorrhage during the operation,
an unsolved issue that could delay the intervention or even cause the patient＊s death. On laparoscopic
surgery this complication is even more dangerous, due to the limited vision and mobility imposed by the
minimally invasive techniques.
Methods: In this paper it is described a computer vision algorithm designed to analyse the images captured
by a laparoscopic camera, classifying the pixels of each frame in blood pixels and background pixels
and nally detecting a massive haemorrhage. The pixel classication is carried out by comparing the
parameter B/R and G/R of the RGB space colour of each pixel with a threshold obtained using the global
average of the whole frame of these parameters. The detection of and starting haemorrhage is achieved
by analysing the variation of the previous parameters and the amount of pixel blood classied.
Results: When classifying in vitro images, the proposed algorithm obtains accuracy over 96%, but during
the analysis of an in vivo images obtained from real operations, the results worsen slightly due to poor
illumination, visual interferences or sudden moves of the camera, obtaining accuracy over 88%. The
detection of haemorrhages directly depends of the correct classication of blood pixels, so the analysis
achieves an accuracy of 78%.
Conclusions: The proposed algorithm turns out to be a good starting point for an automatic detection of
blood and bleeding in the surgical environment which can be applied to enhance the surgeon vision, for
example showing the last frame previous to a massive haemorrhage where the incision could be seen
using augmented reality capabilities.

1. Introduction

On Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), haemorrhages remain one
of the major complications present in all types of interventions,
being particularly dangerous the Major Vascular Injuries (MVI).
Nevertheless, it seems there is no global consensus to classify these
complications [1].
Although there is not an extensive literature on the incidence
of this problem, some authors have carried out some studies on
the subject like Opitz et al. [2] whom analysed more than 43,000
interventions at Swiss hospitals and clinics, concluding that the
incidence of bleedings on laparoscopic surgeries amounts 1.7%
whereas the incidence of MVI amounts 0.09%.
Regarding abdominal surgery, more specically laparoscopic
surgery, we found a study of Opasanon et al. [3] which collect few
previous studies providing an estimation of the incidence around
0.07每1.2%. It is especially interesting the study of Duca et al. [4], in
which the authors analyse the complications occurred during 9542
laparoscopic cholecystectomies for a period of 9 years, conclud-
ing that the incidence of haemorrhages on laparoscopic surgeries
amounts 2.3% and around 1.9% of the operations needs a conversion
to open surgery of which 4.8% where a direct result of a bleeding.
Although these percentages may seem low, it is estimated
around 10每15% of the population of a developed country will be
diagnosed of gallstones and will required a surgical intervention.
This means that in a country like USA where about 750,000 chole-
cystectomies are performed each year, of which near 90% uses MIS
techniques, approximately 15,500 persons will suffer a haemor-
rhage during the surgery and 615 will require a conversion to open
surgery due to this complication [5].
The consequences of a bleeding at a laparoscopic surgery can be
just a simple delay of the intervention, a major recovery time at the
hospital or even the death of the patient as Anna Mases et al. state
in their study [6].
In general, most authors stress the importance of early detec-
tion of bleeding to alleviate their negative effects, therefore it is
required a reliable system able to analyse the characteristics of this
complication and detect it as soon as possible. Due to the prolif-
eration of researches focused on the analysis of images provided
by a laparoscopic camera like the described at [7], it was decided
to design a computer vision algorithm able to detect an internal
haemorrhage during a surgical intervention.
Even though it has not been found in the bibliography any
attempt to develop a computer vision algorithm to detect bleed-
ing or blood in laparoscopic intervention while writing this article,
it does exist a large bibliography focus on the visual detection of a
bleeding through computerized tomography [8,9] and the devel-
opment of classiers algorithms for the images obtained by an
wireless capsule endoscopic (WCE) aimed to detect haemorrhages
in the gastrointestinal tract. Authors based the segmentation and
classication of the pixels on the features extracted using the HVS
colour model [10,11], a two-stage saliency map extraction method
[12] or a simple threshold for the global ratios B/R and G/R in the
BGR colour model [13].
The objective of this paper is to describe the design and imple-
mentation of a computer vision algorithm capable of analyse in real
time the video provided by a laparoscopic camera and detect both
the presence of blood pools and the beginning of a major bleeding.
Once this goal is achieved, the algorithm can be useful for moni-
toring the surgical eld searching for complications that may not
have been detected by the surgical team or even integrated into the
control system of a future autonomous surgical platform.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Experimental material

The analysis of the images is carried out using the open source
computer vision and machine learning software library OpenCV
[14] and tools provided by the framework ROS (Robot Operating
System) [15], in order to integrate the algorithm into a robotic plat-
form which works using the same system. OpenCV is a computer
vision library which provides of basic and advanced functionalities,
such as draw a line, change the colour space of an image or apply a
noise lter. ROS is a collection of software frameworks which pro-
vide with functionalities focused on robot development, and since
their rst versions, the OpenCV libraries are integrated into this
middleware in such a way the ROS nodes can use the functionalities
of this asset with just the inclusion of the proper header le.
For developing and testing our algorithm we have used two
different dataset. The rst dataset is composed of 23 videos of
real laparoscopic surgeries recorded using a camera manned by
a member of the surgical team and show diverse operations
including cholecystectomies, pelvic surgeries, total mesorectal
excisions, radical hysterectomies, pancreatectomy, gastrectomy,
aortic 
lymphadenectomy, retroperitoneal dissections, nephro-
ureterectomies and colectomies. This data set contains 17 videos
that show bleeding (mean duration of 51 s) and six videos that show
no bleeding (mean durations of 33 min and 31 s).
The other dataset is composed of videos of in vitro bleeding
recorded in our setup using a mobile camera and independent
sources of light, carried by miniature robots magnetically attached
to the inner wall of the setup upper lid and externally controlled by
a robotic arm. For this test we used an articial blood composed of
water, glycerine and red and black dyes, pumped by a small water
pump placed out of the setup (Fig. 1). A stepper motor AM1020 from
Faulhaber provides the tilt turn of the camera and all the mini robots
are remotely controlled through an Arduino Mega board. Al these
devices and their communications were proposed and descripted
previously [16,17].

To record the second dataset ve different congurations were
used, recording 15 tests for each conguration. Each conguration
has a different position and view angle for the camera, different
number and positions of the light sources and a different amount
of false blood spotted tissue were used (tissues stained with fake
blood and placed around the receiving reservoir), which represent
the interior of the patient.
Some images have been extracted from each dataset showing
different states of a bleeding. In order to calculate the effectiveness
of the algorithm, a binary map was created for each extracted image
as ground truth, classifying pixels in blood and background.

2.2. Methods: blood pixel classication

First of all, Tonmoy Ghosh＊s [13] and Yixuan Yuan＊s [12] algo-
rithm were checked analysing a few images of in vivo bleedings.
These algorithms were obtained from the reference papers and they
were implemented by the authors. In spite of their good results
classifying blood and non-blood images from a wireless endoscopy
capsule, these algorithms are not designed to work on images with
a high red level, so that the results for the in vivo images were not
satisfactory because the algorithm wrongly classied some tissue
pixels (i.e., liver pixels) as blood pixels, resulting of a lowering of
the specicity. Fig. 2 shows an example of this problem. It was also
observed the red level of the pixels that belongs to blood being
expelled through an incision have a more intense red colour if the
illumination is adequate. Due to the results of the test it was con-
cluded that it is needed an adaptive and dynamic classier able to
correctly segment the image without detecting background pixels
as blood pixels, more restrictive when the frame has a high red level
average and aimed to maintain as low as possible the false positive
rate.
After analysing a series of images from real surgeries, it was
observed a relationship between the individual ratios B/R and G/R
of each pixel and the global ratios B/R and G/R of the frame respec-
tively, with an increase of individual ratios proportional to the
increase of the overall ratios. The individual ratios were calculated
by dividing the green or blue channel of a pixel between the red
channel of the same pixel. The overall ratios were calculated as the
result of dividing the sum of all levels of the green or blue chan-
nels of all the pixels, between the sum of levels of the red channel
of all the pixels, all measured in the BGR colour space. The relation
was quantied using the k-means clustering method and optimized
through a 4-fold cross-validation applied on the previously men-
tioned series of images to obtain a threshold Eq. (1) which separates
the blood and non-blood pixels.
Thresholdratio =
 Frameratio +
 0＊661 
 0＊0084 
Using these dynamics thresholds, the images were analysed
again classifying as blood pixel if both individual pixel ratios
were below the calculated threshold. After the classication, some
morphological transformations of erode and dilation were imple-
mented in order to remove little groups of pixels impossible to
belong to a blood puddle.

2.3. Methods: haemorrhage detection

Once the algorithm performs a segmentation of the image
extracting the possible blood pixels, the obtained parameters were
used to implement the detection of the haemorrhage through an
analysis of the values versus time of both the percentage of blood
pixels as the global ratios B/R and G/R. A great variation of the
analysed parameters was observed approximately during the fol-
lowing one second after the beginning of the bleeding, therefore
it arises that the information needed to detect bleeding can be

obtained from the following 20 frames after the onset of bleed-
ing (the choice of the number of frames to analyse was based on
the use of videos with a ratio of 24 frames per second), comparing
the analysed parameters with a series of thresholds.
It was found that the movement of the camera or the gases emit-
ted when using a laparoscopic electrocautery sometimes causes
an excessive variance of the analysed parameter not related to a
bleeding. In order to solve this problem the algorithm was modify
to discard the parameters of a frame with high variance compared
to the previous frame, assuming that there has been a shake of
the camera rather than the sudden appearance of massive bleed-
ing. Nevertheless, the blood/non-blood pixel classication is not
affected by this problem due to the frame-by-frame design of this
process.
After a thorough analysis we concluded that black, blue and
green pixels quite rarely represent blood being expelled through
an injury. Usually they are light reections, part of the surgical
tools or belong to the black area surrounding the circular region
of the image due to de optic＊s shape. Several tests were carried out
in order to analyse the inuence of these pixels on the algorithm＊s

performance, concluding that if those pixels are not analysed then
the algorithm will slightly worsened its performance but at the
same time will slightly improve the time needed for the analysis,
which depends of the quality of the image and the size of the black
surrounding area.
The complete proposed algorithm is described in Fig. 3.

2.4. Methods: performance measurement

Three parameters were calculated to obtain a measure of the
performance of the analysed algorithms as a binary classica-
tion test: accuracy, sensitivity and specicity, which are calculated
according to the following equations:

The parameters were obtained through a pixel-based compar-
ison, therefore the True Positives are the blood pixels correctly
detected as blood, the True Negatives are background pixels cor-
rectly detected as no blood, the False Positives are background
pixels wrongly detected as blood and the False Negatives are the
blood pixels wrongly detected as background. The sensitivity mea-
sures the amount of blood pixels correctly detected, the specicity
measures the amount of background pixels correctly detected and
the accuracy measures the global effectiveness of an algorithm.

3. Experimental tests

3.1. Blood pixel classication results

A rst experiment was designed to evaluate the blood pixel clas-
sication capability of each algorithm through an analysis of both
dataset, in vitro and in vivo images. The results are shown in Table 1
with the average of the comparison parameters. The experiment
was conducted on 25 in vitro images extracted from 20 different
videos and 32 in vivo images extracted from 23 different videos,
so a total of 52 images (some of them did not show blood) were
analysed with each algorithm.
Even though the three methods have a good performance when
applied to the in vitro images, the results are poor with a low speci-
city when applying Tonmoy Ghosh and Yixuan Yuan methods to
the in vivo images, because the algorithms wrongly classied some
tissue pixels (i.e., liver pixels) as blood pixels. The algorithm pro-
posed in this paper obtains a mediocre sensitivity value, but this
is due in part to the modication made to Eq. (1) to obtain a more
restrictive dynamic threshold and thus to keep the number of false
positives detected low, which allows to obtain a good specicity
value. In images with a surgical environment completely blood
stained, it can be seen the benets of the dynamic threshold, detect-

ing the pixels which belong to the blood owing from an incision
which often have higher levels of red (Fig. 4).

3.2. Haemorrhage detection results

Once validated the classication of the blood pixels, the thresh-
old of the bleeding detection parameters were calculated through
an analysis of the in vitro videos measuring the rst 20 frames after
the rst frame of the bleeding. As mentioned before, 15 tests were
analysed for each one of the ve different congurations, calcu-
lating the average of the minimum and maximum variation of the
analysed parameters (Table 1).
Finally the videos of the in vivo test suite were analysed, trying
different values for comparative thresholds (min B/R variation, min
G/R variation and max blood variation for the last 20 frames) and
seeking to maximize the specicity, that is, reducing the false posi-
tives when classifying the videos in ※shows bleeding§ or ※not shows
bleeding§. The best results were obtained discarding the frames
with at least half of the pixels different respect the previous frame,
detecting sudden sake of the camera. Using as detection conditions
that the sums of B/R and G/R variations during the last 20 frames
0.08 and the sum of the blood percentage varia-
must keep below 
tion during the last 20 frames must keep over 10, the analysis of the
videos obtained an accuracy of 78.26%, a sensitivity of 76.47% and a
specicity of 83.33%. For this analysis, a true positive was achieved
when the algorithm correctly detected a bleeding right after the
blood start pouring from the injury, a true negative was achieved
when the algorithm did not detect any bleeding in a ※non-bleeding
video§, a false negative was achieved when the algorithm did not
detect any bleeding in a ※bleeding video§ and nally a false positive
was achieved when: the algorithm detected a bleeding in a ※non-
bleeding video§, detected a bleeding in a ※bleeding video§ before it
occurs or after the pouring due to a non-related cause (Table 2).

4. Discussions and conclusions

Nowadays, haemorrhages remain one of the major compli-
cations present in MIS interventions and the visual limitations
imposed by the use of a traditional laparoscopic camera hinder
its detection and treatment, increasing the risk for the patient. In
this document the rst steps for the design of a bleeding detec-
tor algorithm are presented, an algorithm able to work using only
the images directly captured by a laparoscopic camera, obtaining
acceptable results as a rst approach. The successful of the analysis
strongly depends of at least three factors that inuence signicantly
the outcome.

Stability of the camera is one of the most important factors. A
sudden movement of the camera can result in the loss of infor-
mation needed to detect bleeding or a false positive due to a
signicantly increasing of the level of red when entering the frame
a reddish tissue. An unmanned vision system, for example con-
trolled by a robot as proposed in [17], will not suffer this issue and
can become a reliable system for detecting bleeding.
The use of an electrocautery is very harmful for detecting bleed-
ing using the proposed method in this paper because the gases
emitted hide the blood, making hard to detect a haemorrhage only
with a visual analysis but easy to solve with a correct control of the
emptying of the gases.

The illumination is the most important factor, as a direct light
on a blood stained surface will create some white reections that
the algorithm is not able to recognize as blood. Using an indepen-
dence source light as proposed in [17] allow the surgical team to
positioning it and avoid the reections.
As a future work the algorithm requires an optimization to
increase its effectiveness, for example enhancing the classication
of pixels against light variations. Another possibility is to merge
this algorithm with a surgical gauze detector algorithm described
in [18], since both elements are strongly associated.
