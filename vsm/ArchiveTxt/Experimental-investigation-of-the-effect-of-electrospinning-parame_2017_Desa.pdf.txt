abstract

Considerable efforts have been devoted to nding economic and simple preparation methods for polydimethyl-
siloxane (PDMS) superhydrophobic membrane in past decades. This study provides a simple method to
electrospin PDMS membrane using poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as carrier polymer. Effects of PMMA
concentration, PDMS/PMMA mass ratio and main parameters of electrospinning process (voltage and injection
rate) were investigated to obtain superhydrophobic membrane with high water contact angle (WCA). A highest
WCA of 163°„ could be obtained on the membrane surface fabricated by electrospinning solution containing
PDMS: PMMA: tetrahydrofuran (THF): N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (mass ratio 1: 1: 8.88: 9.48) under ap-
plied voltage of 11 kV and injection rate of 0.1 mm/min. The superhydrophobic PDMS/PMMA membrane was fur-
ther applied in membrane distillation process for desalination, and a high permeation ux of 39.61 L/m2 h and an
excellent salt rejection of 99.96% were achieved during long-term MD process (24 h).

1. Introduction

Rising demands of superhydrophobic membrane applied for con-
tamination prevention, water repellency, self-cleaning, anti-icing and
anti-corrosion [1] drive the relevant research on the fabrication of
superhydrophobic membrane, whose surface exhibits a water contact
angle (WCA) greater than 150°„ [2]. A variety of techniques, such as
electrospinning, sol-gel method, plasma treatment, lithography and
phase separation are currently adopted to produce superhydrophobic
membrane [3,4]. All these techniques are closely related to low surface
energy materials, either fabricating superhydrophobic membrane
from such materials [5] or modifying membrane into superhydrophobic
membrane by such materials [6].
Compared to other mentioned techniques, electrospinning is an eco-
nomic consistent ber spinning process which produces bers with di-
ameters in the range of nanometer, submicrometer and micrometer.
When a high electric force beyond critical voltage acting on polymeric
solution surface, the surface tension is overcome to realize the slim
charged liquid jet continuously [7]. The liquid jet rstly extends into
jet length, then further stretches into conical spiral motion and whip-
ping motion. Finally, slim bers produced by elongated jet are gathered
on the rotation disc to form at membrane gradually with the evapora-
tion of solvent. Numerous polymeric materials have been electrospun
into continuous, uniform bers [8,9]. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a
kind of elastomeric material and superhydrophobic polymer [4], has
been widely applied in the fabrication of superhydrophobic materials
mainly by one-step laser etching method [10] and plasma treatment
[11]. The properties of low surface energy, low surface density and
strong water repellence make PDMS an effective material in organics
extraction [12], catalysts supports [13] and contamination prevention
[14].
Though
PDMS material
itself
is
suitable
for making
superhydrophobic membrane, it is quite difcult to be electrospun
due to insufcient chain entanglements during electrospinning as a
small molecular polymer [15,16]. In order to obtain electrospun PDMS
membrane, poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was added into the
electrospinning solution as carrier polymer [15,16]. It is believed that
these two blending polymers change the intrinsic characterization of
the insufcient chain entanglements existing in single PDMS polymer.
Macromolecule PMMA could be easily electrospun into continuous -
bers, while fragmentary PDMS bers are distributed around PMMA -
bers irregularly. The covalent bonds are produced between PDMS and
PMMA bers and then electrospun PDMS/PMMA membrane is pro-
duced. Though PDMS/PMMA membrane was successfully electrospun,
this PDMS/PMMA membrane was used for protein microarrays as sub-
strates [15,16] and the effects of system parameters (e.g. polymer con-
centration, viscosity) and process parameters (e.g. voltage, injection
rate) on membrane morphology and hydrophobicity were not studied.
The morphology and hydrophobicity of the electrospun membrane
have signicant effects on its further applications [17]. Thus, it is neces-
sary to investigate the effects of various parameters on the morphology
and hydrophobicity
of
PDMS/PMMA membrane made
by
electrospinning.
Membrane distillation (MD) is a thermally-driven separation pro-
cess, which is driven by the vapor pressure difference existing between
the porous hydrophobic membrane surfaces [18]. Due to its low operat-
ing temperatures, less energy consumption, as well as 100% theoretical
rejection of non-volatile solute, MD is considered to be a next-genera-
tion water desalination technique [19,20]. An ideal membrane for MD
should exhibit a superhydrophobic surface to avoid pore wetting and
a well-designed pore structure to enhance water ux [21]. Therefore,
the PDMS/PMMA membrane with high porosity, tunable pore size and
considerable wetting resistance could be a great candidate for its appli-
cation in MD. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on
electrospun PDMS/PMMA membrane used in MD process in the open
literature.
In this study, PDMS/PMMA superhydrophobic membranes were
electrospun using electrospinning solution of different amounts of
PDMS and PMMA under different electrospinning process parameters.
The electrospun PDMS/PMMA membranes were characterized by goni-
ometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), 3D automatic optical prol-
er, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and tensile testing machine.
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of electrospinning
system parameters (PMMA concentration, PDMS/PMMA mass ratio) and
process parameters (voltage, injection rate) on morphology and hydro-
phobicity of the electrospun PDMS/PMMA membrane. The lab-made
electrospun PDMS/PMMA membrane was further applied for the desali-
nation in membrane distillation process. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the rst attempt to investigate the effects of electrospinning param-
eters on properties of electrospun PDMS/PMMA membrane and apply it
in membrane distillation for desalination.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Preparation of electrospinning solution

Weighted PMMA (9 .9 °¡ 105 Da , Sigma Aldrich) was rstly dis-
so lved in a m ixed so lvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N ,N-
dimethylformamide (DMF) by stirring 2 h (200 rpm, 50 °„C). Then,
weighted PDMS (Sylgard 184 , Dow Corning) together with curing

agent (10:1) was added by st irr ing 30 m in (200 rpm , 25 °„C) . A
LVDV-S rotary viscometer (Brookeld, USA) with S62 stirrer under
a speed of 50 rpm was used to measure the viscosities of prepared
electrospinning solutions at 25 °„C. All the involved chemicals were
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), other-
w ise be ing noted . They are of ana lyt ical grade and were direct ly
applied in experiments without further purication.

2.2. Electrospinning of membrane

An integrated electrospinning machine (SS 20H, Ucalery, China) was
used to fabricate the electrospinning solutions into micro-brous mem-
branes under certain temperature (25 °¿ 3 °„C) and humidity (35 °¿ 5%).
The electrospinning solution was loaded into a 10 mL plastic syringe
connecting 18# steel needle (0.86 mm inner diameter). Positive voltage
was regulated as needed accompanied with a negative voltage of
1.00 kV. Different solution injection rates were tried and the
electrospinning time was adjusted for consuming equal solution. The
tip to collector distance (TCD) was maintained at 16 cm and the collec-
tor (50 rpm) was covered by tinfoil to receive the elongated bers,
which would further form membrane. After electrospinning process,
the membranes were placed under 70 °„C for 120 min to volatilize resid-
ual solvent and form cross-linking.

2.3. Characterization of membrane

2.3.1. Contact angle
The hydrophobicity of membrane surface was evaluated by WCA
using Dropmeter A-200 contact angle system (MAIST Vision Inspection
& Measurement Co., China) with corresponding Dropmeter software.
Liquid droplet (9 ¶ÃL) was dropped on at least ve different points of
each membrane for average and the algorithm of Young-Laplace was se-
lected to analyze the contact angles above 90°„.

2.3.2. Morphology
The morphologies of electrospun membranes were characterized by
a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM - 6700F, JEOL, Japan). All
samples (1 °¡ 1 cm) were observed by SEM directly without coating
gold layer as the electrical conductivity of membranes could satisfy
the observational requirements. Averaged ber diameters were calcu-
lated by corresponding SEM images. Pore sizes were measured using a
3H-2000PB membrane pore size analyzer (Beishide, China) by bubble-
pressure method.

2.3.3. XPS analysis
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of membranes were
recorded by a Kratos Axis UltraDLD spectrometer (Shimadzu-Kratos,
Japan) with a monochromatic Al K¶¡ radiation of 1486.6 eV. The analyz-
er was set to hybrid magnication mode under a take-off angle of 90°„,
while analysis area was about 700 °¡ 300 ¶Ãm under slot mode. Limited
pressure of analysis chamber was set to b 5 °¡ 10 9 Torr. A binding ener-
gy (BE, 0®C1200 eV) was used for wide spectrum scan, and correspond-
ing X-ray source power was 75 W with a range of 75®C 150 W for
different elements in narrow spectrum scan. In addition, scanning
steps and pass energies of 1 eV, 160 eV and 0.1 eV, 40 eV were employed

in wide spectrum scan and narrow spectrum scan, respectively. The BE
shifting of each element was calibrated by C1 s peak on 284.8 eV of sam-
ple surface. All samples were processed by the build-in Kratos charge
neutralizer system to avoid the inuence of charge effect.

2.3.4. Roughness
Surface prole and roughness of electrospun membranes were given
by a 3D automatic optical proler (ZeGage, ZygoLamda, USA) with a
50 °¡ camera lens. Three 2 °¡ 2 cm samples taken from different locations
of each membrane were employed to average the roughness of mem-
brane surface, mainly by two amplitude metrics: roughness average
(Sa) and root mean square roughness (Sq). Sa is the averaged roughness
of the sample area (167 °¡ 167 ¶Ãm), and Sq is the mean square root of
surface roughness for characterizing the surface roughness deviation.
The scan scope of 50.0 ¶Ãm was set to the center position mode while
the signal thresh was set to 0.2%.

2.3.5. Thickness
Thickness of each membrane was measured using a membrane
thickness gauge (Ch-12.7-JSM-6700F, Liuling, China). Five measure-
ments at different position of each membrane were performed to obtain
a mean value for better representation of thickness.

2.3.6. Tensile strength
Membrane mechanical properties of tensile strength (kPa), limiting
stress (N) and elongation at break (%) were obtained with an electronic
universal testing machine (6020, Zwick/Roell, Germany). Membranes
were cut into a rectangle shape (70 °¡ 10 mm) and tested under 0.7 N
pre-load and 10 mm/min crosshead speed.

2.4. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) test

A direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) apparatus is set up
to evaluate the membrane performance for desalination. The
electrospun membrane with an effective area of 9.6 cm2 was xed in
the circle cell module supported by a water-permeable PET layer. This
placed membrane divided the cell module into feed solution side
(down) and permeate solution side (up). The feed solution (1.5 L) was
3.5 wt% NaCl solution prepared in puried water with a conductivity
(Cf) of 66.5 mS/cm, while the permeate solution was 1.5 L of puried
water with a conductivity (Cp) of 1.2®C 1.8 ¶ÃS/cm. Flow rates of 1.0 and
0.5 L/min were used for feed side and permeate side via two gear
pumps during all MD experiments. The temperature of feed solution
was maintained at 70 °„C by heating bath and the permeate solution

was maintained at 25 °„C by a condenser. Weight of permeate tank
was measured every 10 min by an electronic balance (YP10001,
Guansen, China) to calculate membrane ux and conductivity of perme-
ate solution was also recorded every 10 min by a conductivity meter
(HI87314, HANNA, Italy) to calculate salt rejection. The liquid entry
pressure (LEP) of membrane was determined following the method
provided by another study [19]. Three frequently-used commercial
membranes for DCMD were also employed in this MD process to com-
pare their performances under same setup and conditions. They are
PTFE membranes
from Membrane Solutions MSPTFE022ETBX
(MPTFE-1) and MSPTFE045ETBX (MPTFE-2), and PVDF membrane
from Millipore (HVHP4700 (MPVDF)).

mixture containing equal volumes of DMF and THF was employed as
solvent system [22]. The solubility parameter (¶ƒ) of THF is about 9.5,
which is close to that of PMMA (9.1®C9.5) and PDMS (7.3®C7.6), making
THF a good solvent for both PMMA and PDMS. Though the ¶ƒ value of
co-solvent DMF (12.1) is not compatible with PMMA and PDMS, adding
DMF could avoid excess solvent volatilization during electrospinning
process.
Morphologies and thicknesses of three membranes with different
PMMA concentrations are shown in Table S1. It is observed that mem-
brane M1-1 (39.2 °¿ 3.2 ¶Ãm) was quite thin compared to other two
membranes, M1-3 (185.2 °¿ 9.9 ¶Ãm) was too dense surrounding by
quantities of ocs, and only M1-2 (71.2 °¿ 5.3 ¶Ãm) possessed stable
membrane structure accompanied with a few ocs. Therefore, the
electrospinning solution with PMMA concentration of 10.9% is ap-
proved to be best choice for PDMS/PMMA membrane fabrication from
the aspect of the membrane morphology. Fig. 1 shows the viscosities
of electrospinning solution and the contact angles of electrospun mem-
branes. With PMMA concentration increasing from 5.4% to 16.3%, the
viscosity of electrospinning solution increased from 26.8 °¿ 1.2 cP
(M1-1) to 1502.0 °¿ 55.7 cP (M1-3) dramatically. Similar trend was
not seen in WCA on electrospun membrane surface. The WCA of mem-
brane increased from 135.3 °¿ 4.9°„ for M1-1 with PMMA concentration
of 5.4% to 153.6 °¿ 2.7°„ for M1-2 with PMMA concentration of 10.9%, and
then declined to 146.9 °¿ 3.9°„ (M1-3) when PMMA concentration in-
creased to 16.3%. Low PMMA dosage in M1-1 led to the low viscosity
of electrospinning solution, which made fabricated M1-1 quite thin
with large pore size (15.95 ¶Ãm). Therefore, M1-1 was easier to be wet-
ted and had a signicant lower WCA in comparison with M1-1 and
M1-2. Based on results of contact angle, the electrospinning solution
with PMMA concentration of 10.9% could be considered as best condi-
tion for fabricating superhydrophobic membrane.
Fig. 2 shows XPS spectrum of M1-2 surface. It is observed that only
elements carbon (C), oxygen (O) and silicon (Si) were detected when
hydrogen (H) is not included as an immeasurable element in XPS anal-
ysis. The relative elemental composition was determined based on the
intensity of the O (1 s, 2 s), Si (2 s, 2p) and C (1 s) peaks centered around
532.5 (1 s), 102.5 (2 p), and 284.8 eV, respectively. C was the most
abundant element with an atom concentration of 54.0%, while the
atom concentrations of O and Si were 25.9% and 20.1%, respectively. Ac-
cording to previous studies, the peaks of Si (2 s) and Si (2 p) belong to
PDMS, and the peaks of O (1 s, 2 s), C (1 s) belong to both PDMS and
PMMA [16,23,24]. Such elemental compositions provided clear evi-
dence that the surface of M1-2 contained predominantly PMMA and
PDMS and no chemical reaction happened between PDMS and PMMA
during electrospinning. The intensity of C (1 s) peak was about
29,000 cps in 284.8 eV. This peak is generally related to the C

a The negative voltage was set to 1.00 kV. Other solvent, environmental and
electrospinning parameters (not listed in Table 3) were the same as those listed in Table 1.

Fig. 4(a) shows that the viscosity of electrospinning solution in-
creased from 167.0 °¿ 1.7 cP for M2-1 to 266.2 °¿ 2.2 cP for M2-5 as
PDMS/PMMA mass ratio increases from 0/1 to 2/1. The observation
that PDMS/PMMA ber diameter would increase with the increase
of solution viscosity is also in agreement with Yang et al. [16]. In ad-
dition , Fig . 4(a) shows the WCA of the membranes with d if ferent
PDMS/PMMA rat ios .
It is observed that WCA increased from
144.1 °¿ 5.9°„ for M2-2 to 153.6 °¿ 2.7°„ for M2-3 with the increase of
PDMS/PMMA mass rat io . However , further increase of PDMS/
PMMA mass rat io d id not lead to h igher WCA . WCA for M2-4
dropped to 145.4 °¿ 4.4°„ and further decreased to 140.6 °¿ 10.9°„ for

high roughness would inhibit the migration of cells from surface
into inner part by minimizing valid contact area [30].
It is concluded that the increase of PDMS/PMMA mass ratio lead
to increased solution viscosity, which further caused the increase of
ber diameter and less beads formed. The formation of beads was
found to be benecial to obtain higher contact angle due to higher
roughness and smaller pore size . The correlation between contact
angle and roughness (Sq) was established with a correlation coef-
cient of about 0.790 (Fig. 4(b)). The optimum electrospinning solu-
tion for superhydrophobic membrane fabrication was a mixture of
PDMS/PMMA/THF/DMF (1/1/8 .88/9 .48 ca lculated by mass) , and
this electrospinning solution was chosen in further experiments to
investigate the effect of electrospinning process parameters.

3.2. Effect of process parameters on membrane properties

3.2.1. Effect of voltage
Fig. 5(a) shows the SEM images of PDMS/PMMA electrospun mem-
branes obtained with different positive voltages of 10 kV (M3-1), 11 kV
(M3-2), 13 kV (M3-3) and 15 kV (M3-4). The mean ber diameter of
these membranes decreased from 1.94 ¶Ãm (M3-1) to 1.68 ¶Ãm (M3-4,
listed in Table 3) as the applied voltage increased from 10 kV to 15 kV.
It is believed that when applied positive voltage increases, enhanced
electrostatic force would act on electrospinning solution jet at needle
tip to promote the solvent volatilization for the ber formation with de-
creased diameter [7,31,32]. It is also observed that the number and size
of beads reduced slightly with the increase of voltage. Higher voltage
could promote whipping instability and inhibit axisymmetric instabil-
ities, and then ber with smaller bead would form under higher draw-
ing stress at solution jet [27]. The membrane pore size was found to
increase from 7.70 ¶Ãm to 11.73 ¶Ãm continuously with increasing applied
voltage from 10 kV to 15 kV as shown in Fig. 5(b) and listed in Table 3.
Therefore, it could be concluded that the increase of voltage could lead
to the decrease of ber diameter, bead formation and the increase of
pore size.
In addition, Fig. 5(c) shows the surface roughness of these mem-
branes. No obvious differences were observed for the roughness param-
eters of the membranes M3-1, M3-3 and M3-4 except M3-2 made with
voltage of 11 kV. Its Sq was 7.5 ¶Ãm, while the corresponding values for
other membranes were about 6.4®C6.7 ¶Ãm. M3-2 also possessed the
highest Sa value of 6.1 ¶Ãm in contrast with low Sa values (5.1®C5.3 ¶Ãm)
of other membranes, which indicated its surface containing more ups
and downs than other membranes. Multilevel roughness in hierarchical
structure of membrane is considered to be essential to approach ex-
treme superhydrophobicity. When a 9 ¶ÃL water droplet was placed on
M3-2, an almost spherical droplet was observed and WCA of 160.5 °¿
6.1°„ was measured as shown in Fig. 6(a). WCAs of other membranes
were all below 157°„: 156.5 °¿ 1.8°„ (M3-1), 154.7 °¿ 2.9°„ (M3-3) and
150.0 °¿ 9.8°„ (M3-4), indicating M3-2 is the most superhydrophobic
membrane. A positive correlation between contact angle and roughness
(Sq) was established with a correlation coefcient of about 0.794 (Fig.
6(b)). Based on WCA measurements, 11 kV seemed to be most suitable
choice as positive voltage for electrospun under these parameters.

M2-5. The presence of beads was found to be benecial to fabricate
the membrane with h igh WCA in th is study though usua l ly be ing
regarded as °∞by-products°± in other e lec trospinning process [28] .
The highest WCA and roughness were observed on M2-3 , and the
lowest WCA and roughness were observed on M2-5, which indicated
that WCA of membrane probably is well related with its roughness.
This is in agreement with Wenzel model, which believes that mem-
brane with rougher surface is usually correlated well with more hy-
drophob ic surface w ith h igher WCA [29] . The morphology o f
membrane with high roughness seemed to be benecial to receive
high WCA by minimiz ing the valid contact area between water
drop and membrane as it had been conrmed that membrane with

3.2.2. Effect of injection rate
Morphology of electrospun membrane is usually related to the injec-
tion rate to a great extent [33]. Selected injection rates of 0.05 mm/min
(M4-1), 0.1 mm/min (M4-2), 0.2 mm/min (M4-3), 0.5 mm/min (M4-4)
were employed for membrane optimization with other optimum condi-
tions unchanged. Fig. S2 shows the morphologies of membranes made

under different injection rates. The mean diameter of bers was ob-
served to increase from 1.28 ¶Ãm for M4-1 to 2.89 ¶Ãm for M4-4 with in-
jection rate increasing from 0.05 mm/min to 0.5 mm/min (Table 4). The
ber diameter of M4-4 was much larger than diameters of other mem-
branes and presented analogous silver ragwort leave structures, and
numbers of hierarchical nano/micro-structure grooves were also

found on bers. In addition, the thickness of membrane as shown in
Table 4 increased from 29.6 °¿ 4.4 ¶Ãm for M4-1 to 125.0 °¿ 10.6 ¶Ãm for
M4-4 when the injection rate increased from 0.05 to 0.5 mm/min
with other parameters unchanged. The increase of injection rate also
led to the increase of pore size from 6.25 ¶Ãm for M4-1 to 12.14 ¶Ãm for
M4-4 (Fig. 7(a)). With the increase of
injection rate, more
electrospinning solution could be injected to needle tip within the
same time. The superuous solution jet is difcult to stretch sufciently
under the same electrostatic force and the solvent is difcult to evapo-
rate sufciently in the short electrospinning time. Therefore, higher in-
jection rate would lead to the electrospun membrane with larger ber
diameter and thicker membrane eventually.
Fig. 7(b) shows the surface pictures by prolometer of these four
membranes. A signicantly higher roughness (Sq = 8.9 ¶Ãm, Sa =
7.3 ¶Ãm) was detected on the M4-2 surface than those of other mem-
branes. The WCA (listed in Table 4) of the M4-2 was found to be
163.1 °¿ 3.5°„, whereas that for other membranes was 157.6 °¿ 4.3°„
(M4-1), 160.5 °¿ 6.1°„ (M4-3) and 155.5 °¿ 2.1°„ (M4-4) respectively,
which indicates roughness is well-related with hydrophobicity. It is fur-
ther observed that M4-2 owned the most and largest beads, while the
formed beads on other membranes were relatively fewer and smaller.
These results revealed that bead-rich membrane was likely to generate
rougher surface and larger WCA than the bead-less membrane.
In summary, the optimum electrospinning parameters were chosen
as follows to provide the membrane most hydrophobic property: TCD of
16 cm, voltage of 11 kV,
injection rate of 0.1 mm/min with
electrospinning environmental parameters of temperature 25 °„C
and humidity 35%. The electrospun membrane under this condition
(M4-2) was also used in the further mechanical test and membrane
distillation.

3.3. Mechanical property

The stress-elongation curve together with surface morphology of
M4-2 is presented in Fig. 8. This curve indicated that M4-2 belonged
to homogeneous-plastic material. The entire elongation stage of M4-2
were divided into elastic phase, yield stage, extensional phase and neck-
ing stage according to the phases of normal plastic material. Table 5 pro-
vides the corresponding mechanical properties of limiting stress, tensile
strength and elongation at break of M4-2. In the end of elastic phase
(just before the peak of the curve), the force increased rapidly to a lim-
iting force of 1.19 N assuming the force area is unchanged. The stress for
M4-2 increased to 1833.89 kPa at the end of yield phase (just after the
peak of the curve). Most of M4-2 bers began to break at elongation
of 25%, causing the huge decrease of stress as presented in Fig. 8. This
huge decrease indicated the beginning of extensional phase. Then, the
stress for M4-2 decreased dramatically to about 700 kPa in extensional
phase and valley of stress-elongation curve indicated the end of exten-
sional phase and the beginning of necking phase. All bers of M4-2 were
broken at elongation of 58.72% at the end of necking phase. These prop-
erties indicated that M4-2 was deformed easily and this was also the
reason for using a water-permeable PET layer as supporting layer in
the following MD process.

3.3.1. Short-term membrane distillation performance
Fig. 9 shows the direct contact membrane distillation apparatus (a)
and corresponding membrane distillation performances for M4-2 and
three commercial membranes during 360 min (b). Relevant parameters
for MD process were: 1.0 L/min and 0.5 L/min for the velocities of feed
solution and permeate solution, 70 °„C and 25 °„C for the temperatures
of feed solution and permeate solution, respectively, which were the
optimum conditions for M4-2 as shown in Fig. S3. The detailed mem-
brane properties and MD performances are shown in Table 6. The aver-
aged permeation ux of M4-2 was about 42.52 L/m2 h during 360 min
MD process with relatively obvious uctuations (35.00®C49.38 L/m2 h),
which was higher than that of commercial PTFE membrane (MPTFE-1,

Fig. 8. Mechanical property of M4-2 and corresponding morphology of M4-2 surface.

40.93 L/m2 h) and PVDF membrane (MPVDF, 37.19 L/m2 h) with rela-
tively smaller uctuations. The main reason for this high ux might be
its large pore size (8.03 ¶Ãm), which made the vapor could permeate the
membrane more easily with lower mass transfer resistance. The conduc-
tivity of superhydrophobic M4-2's permeate solution was 3.9 ¶ÃS/cm with
a conductivity variation of permeate solution (¶§Cp) of 2.3 ¶ÃS/cm after
360 min test resulting in a salt rejection above 99.99%. The ¶§Cps of
MPTFE-1 and MPVDF (6.7 and 4.7 ¶ÃS/cm) were all higher than that of
M4-2. Although the permeation ux of M4-2 was lower than that of an-
other commercial PTFE membrane (MPTFE-2, 49.01 L/m2 h), the ¶§Cp
(10.0 ¶ÃS/cm) of MPTFE-2 was signicantly higher than that of M4-2.
These results demonstrated that membrane with superhydrophobicity
(WCA N 150°„) was more likely to obtain superior salt rejections than
membrane with hydrophobicity (90 b WCA b 150°„).
The LEP value of M4-2 (13 kPa) was signicantly higher in compar-
ison with the pressure of membrane chamber during experiment
(0 kPa). This membrane LEP value was lower than the LEP values of
commercial MD membranes (81®C137 kPa) compared. However, a high
salt rejection was still obtained during MD process which might mainly
due to the superhydrophobicity of PDMS/PMMA membrane. Though
pore size of M4-2 was relatively larger than the usually employed mem-
brane pore size (b 0.5 ¶Ãm) for MD process, the obtained permeation ux
and salt rejection efciency were considerably impressive due to the
strong water repellency and large porosity. Therefore, M4-2 is suitable
for MD process, especially under free-pressure or low-pressure. These
results expand the membrane selectable range for MD process remark-
ably, which ensures that superhydrophobic membrane with large pore
size could be employed in MD process.

3.3.2. Long-term membrane distillation performance
A long-term MD process for M4-2 was conducted to investigate its ac-
tual MD evaluation as a stand-alone desalination process. The data of ux
variation and conductivity variation was logged every 2 h for 32 h as
shown in Fig. 9(c). The permeation ux was about 42.37 L/m2 h during
the rst 12 h with a relatively stable ¶§Cp (5.4 ¶ÃS/cm). Although the
permeation ux of M4-2 reected a decreasing tendency from 12 h
(41.62 L/m2 h) to 24 h (33.10 L/m2 h), this trend was relatively smooth,
only about 20.8%. This ux decline indicated the pore wetting of mem-
brane and the corresponding temperature polarization [34], therefore,
the normal permeate path of vapor was blocked resulting in a lower
ux than initial. The decreasing tendency became sharper and sharper
after 24 h of operation. As a multiple ber layers matrix could contain
gaps or pores in each layer, M4-2 could be gradually invaded by small
salt water drops when feed solution owed through its membrane sur-
face [35]. Therefore, pore blockage became more and more serious due

to gradual pore wetting and salt invasion. The severe pore wetting and
pore blockage reduced the driving force between feed and permeate
sides for vapor mass transfer [34,35], which consequently brought more
serious ux decline from 33.10 L/m2 h (24 h) to 7.25 L/m2 h (32h) as it
can be seen in Fig. 9(c). The conductivity increased signicantly from
12 h (6.9 ¶ÃS/cm) to 32 h (90.2 ¶ÃS/cm) especially after 30 h (42.8 ¶ÃS/cm)

leading to an inferior salt rejection about 99.87%, and this also could be
regarded as an indication for salt invasion. The yellow crystallizing on
membrane after MD process and corresponding membrane WCA
(121.2 °¿ 3.4°„) as shown in Fig. S4(a) and (b) conrmed the above hy-
pothesis of pore wetting and salt invasion. Results demonstrate this
PDMS/PMMA electrospun membrane has potential to be employed in
long-term (b 24 h) membrane distillation application as qualied MD
the membranes with considerable averaged ux of 39.61 L/m2 h and
salt rejection of 99.96%.

4. Conclusions

The results presented in this study are the rst to correlate the
electrospinning parameters with the properties of PDMS/PMMA
electrospun membranes. Signicant correlations were found between
polymer concentration, voltage, injection rate and ber diameter. Sig-
nicant effect was also observed for bead formation on membrane
roughness. The mass ratio 1/1/8.88/9.48 of PDMS/PMMA/THF/DMF
was the best candidate for electrospinning solution system. A highest
WCA of 163°„ could be obtained at 11 kV voltage and 0.1 mm/min injec-
tion rate under temperature of 25 °„C and humidity of 35%. This high hy-
drophobicity was related to the surface roughness and beads structure.
Obtained tensile testing results suggested that the PDMS/PMMA
electrospun membrane was homogeneous-plastic material with a ten-
sile strength of 1833.89 kPa. Considerable averaged membrane ux
(39.61 L/m2 h) and excellent salt rejection efciency (99.96%) during
24 h MD process revealed that this novel PDMS/PMMA electrospun
membrane could be a suitable candidate for desalination using mem-
brane distillation process especially under free-pressure or low-
pressure.
