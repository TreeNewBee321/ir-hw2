abstract

This work offers an extensive framework for the techno-economic evaluation of the subsurface and surface com-
ponents of low-grade geothermal (b 100 ∼C) desalination systems, that is based on validated hydrogeological,
thermodynamic, and economic considerations. Additionally, this work incorporates a recently developed ad-
vanced multi-effect distillation (MED) process for an improved utilisation of the geothermal heat sources.
The analysis focuses on a pre-feasibility study for Western Australia, the inuence of the different cost drivers,
especially the often overlooked geothermal well eld parameters like permeability, so as to permit rational as-
sessments of potential application sites. For the surveyed area in Western Australia, the conuence of geothermal
and desalination systems results in a promising and economically viable alternative water source.

1. Introduction

Geothermal energy is a promising renewable energy. Its climatic, di-
urnal and seasonal independent characteristic allows for a quantiable,
reliable and extremely stable energy supply, which is perfect for
desalination.
In 1959 Bell [1] conducted an economic analysis of a 75 m3/day geo-
thermal driven Multi-Effect-Evaporation plant. A decade later, the US
Department of Reclamation in California attempted to generate fresh-
water directly from high temperature (N 150 ∼C) geothermal uid [2].
Different desalination methods have since been evaluated [3,4], includ-
ing a Multi Stage Flash (MSF) and a Vertical-Tube-Evaporator (VTE)
pilot plant [5]. The rst patent of a desalination unit designed for
high-enthalpy geothermal sites was issued in 1976 [6]. In 1982, Ophir
[7] undertook a preliminary economic study of geothermal desalination
between 100 and 150 ∼C in Israel. Since 1990s, extensive research has
been undertaken to utilise geothermal resources on the Cyclades Islands
in Greece. This included the use of low-enthalpy (b 100 ∼C) geothermal
energy to power Multi-Effect-Distillation (MED) for seawater desalina-
tion on the islands of Milos [8,9] and Kimolos [10每13], with recent plans
being reported for Nisyros [14]. On the Baja California Peninsula, Mexi-
co, potential geothermal resources suitable for desalination have been
discovered [15]. The utilisation of low- and medium-enthalpy sources
is considered for seawater desalination using a tailored 20 m3/day
MED design [16每18]. More recently, Oman planned to tap into the ex-
tensive low-enthalpy aquifer present in the Sultanate and the wider re-
gion for geothermal desalination [19]. Current research also includes the
coupling of geothermal sources with the emerging Membrane Distilla-
tion (MD) [20,21], hybrid systems aiming toward polygeneration of
water and energy [22], as well as the implementation of geothermal
driven Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems [23,24].

So far besides very general cost estimations for concrete applica-
tions [9,11,14,18,25,26], very limited research has been undertaken
on detailed techno-economic analysis for the geographically more
prevalent low-enthalpy (b 100 ∼C) systems [17 ,24] . Furthermore ,
where such studies had been undertaken, they were invariably fo-
cused on the above-ground infrastructure where the geotherma l
source was simply cons idered as a xed source of energy for the
matching of commercial desalination systems. Such an approach un-
derestimates the full implications of geothermal desalination for two
reasons.

(1) In most cases, especially for deep low-enthalpy geothermal
applications, the geothermal reservoir is not adequately
characterised by a single pre-set point source. While its temper-
ature can be fairly accurately predicted by the geothermal gradi-
ent, parameters like permeability and transmissivity of the aquifer
can vary considerably with depths thereby impacting the opera-
tions and economics of the system. In fact, typically a system-
specic optimum for the geothermal well eld and the desalina-
tion plant exists, which requires both systems to be considered in
tandem.

(2) The cost structure of geothermal systems differs fundamental-
ly from ※convent iona l§ energy sources . While typically the
cost of energy occurs as operational expenditure by unit of en-
ergy consumed, in geothermal systems this cost is replaced by
the large cap ital expend itures for the geothermal resource ,
e .g . exploration and provision of the we lls/infrastructure .
The cost of a geothermal system lies with the provision of hot
geothermal uid at the surface, which is almost independent
of the extent of energy being extracted for downstream pro-
cesses. For an economic operation of geothermal desalination
systems a maximal energy extrac tion from the geothermal
u id is therefore favourable [27] and the ir performance
should be measured by the waste heat performance ratio [28].
Established thermal desalination designs adopted from con-
ventional applications are most often incapable of addressing
this requirement sufciently , thereby resulting in unit pro-
duction rates far below the potential of the geothermal source
[28,29].

This article aims to address these issues in the Western Australian
context and provides tools to assess the potential of low-enthalpy geo-
thermal resources for desalination in a more holistic way.
In addition, this article will show that by considering thermal desa-
lination technologies tailored for low-grade heat sources, like Boosted
MED (B-MED) [28每31] and Preheated Boosted MED (PB-MED), an im-
proved utilisation of the geothermal resource can be realised, and signif-
icantly improve the economic prospects of the hydrothermal low-
enthalpy geothermal desalination systems.

1.1. Hydrothermal, low-enthalpy geothermal desalination

This article focuses on the Hot Sedimentary Aquifer (HSA) geo-
thermal reservoirs [32,33], which are prevalent in Australia.

Fig. 1. Simplistic schematic of a low-enthalpy geothermal MED plant.

From these low-enthalpy sources, the hot geothermal uid is ex-
tracted from the deep sedimentary aquifer and conveyed to the surface
under pressure, so as to prevent the onset of precipitation. Heat is then
harvested whereupon the colder geothermal uid is re-injected into the
aquifer [34,35]. The technology, reliability, economics, and environmen-
tal acceptability of such direct-heat geothermal applications have been
widely demonstrated for district heating or heated swimming pools, es-
pecially in Western Australia [36].
Where sufciently high reservoir temperatures are encountered, a
conversion into mechanical work via Organic Rankine Cycles or Kalina
processes is possible, which can be used to power RO units as demon-
strated for example by Loutatidou and Arafat [24]. Stemming from the
well known Carnot efciency, however, the strong dependence of the
conversion efciency on the temperature differential between heat
source and sink economically constraints these systems to a minimum
temperature of about 100 ∼C. Operating at a reservoir temperature of
98 ∼C the Birdsville geothermal power station in Queensland, Australia,
for example, achieves a heat use efciency of 4% only [37]. In our context
where a full re-injection of geothermal uid is mandated, this can barely
compensate for the full pumping power of the geothermal uid, let
alone supply power to a RO plant of practical capacity.
Hence at economically accessible depths with temperature levels
below 100 ∼C, geothermal MED technology is offering a superior tech-
no-economic solution.
Fig. 1 depicts a simplied schematic of a conventional geothermal
driven MED system to treat saline surface water. Depending on the geo-
chemistry, the system can either be directly heated by the geothermal
water as shown in the gure, or indirectly via a secondary heating me-
dium cycle or ashing process so as to manage scaling and contamina-
tion issues.
Novel variations of the MED process particularly designed for such
low grade heat applications, like the Boosted MED (B-MED) as in Fig. 2,

have been developed that provide up to 30% more freshwater produc-
tion over conventional MED systems [28].
A Preheated Boosted MED (PB-MED) is shown in Fig. 3, which by
using two preheaters the heat source energy can be recovered further,
while the production rate is increased as compared to both convention-
al and boosted MED systems. The impact of preheaters to improve the
production rate of a conventional MED process has been widely
discussed in [31]. With the same aim, we use preheaters to increase
the production rate of the Boosted MED in this new layout (Fig. 3),
while it is being coupled to a hydrothermal, low-enthalpy geothermal
source. As shown in Fig. 3, the heat source outlet temperature is the low-
est compared to both conventional and Boosted MED (Figs.1 and 2)
which is translated into a better utilisation of heat source energy
(Appendix C). Synergistically the further cooling down of the heat
source medium by means of the booster unit (in B-MED process) or
additional preheaters (in PB-MED) can be manifested into a reduced
re-injection depth and therefore considerably decreased well costs
(re fer to Section 2 .2) , prov ided that geo log ica l , geochem ica l , and
environmental restrictions do not contradict such a reduction in re-
injection depth.
The viability of the abovementioned novel processes layouts have
been demonstrated via a pilot plant incorporating key features of the
Boosted MED technology (Fig. 4), which shows a 57% additional vapour
production in the downstream evaporator compared with that of the
primary MED [30].

2. Techno-economic analysis of a low-enthalpy geothermal system

A ho l ist ic approach that cons iders the fu l l imp l icat ions of a
geothermal resource toward minimising the levelised cost of water
requires a coupled analysis of both the geothermal system and desa-
l inat ion plant subsect ions . The leve l ised cost of water can be

expressed as the quotient of the total (annualised) costs, Can, and the
annual water production, Dan:

2.1. Capital and operating expenditures of the desalination plant

A reliable approximation of the capital expenditure, Ccap , DESAL, of de-
salination plants is possible based on the GWI's Desalting Plant Invento-
ry [38]. For conventional and Boosted MED plants up to a capacity of
10,000 m3/day, the following conservative cost functions, in US$, can
be applied, respectively [39].

However, for the Preheated Boosted MED, the price of preheaters
which is estimated based on the functions below for grade 1 titanium

ital cost function and adjusted by the producer price index.

2.2.2. Operational expenditures of the geothermal system, Cop , GEO
The major operational expenditures of deep Hot Sedimentary Aqui-
fer geothermal systems pertain to the energy required to pump the geo-
thermal uid to the surface and the subsequent reinjection into the
aquifer. This auxiliary power, welec , GEO, is heavily dependent on the
characteristics of the well eld and may render an otherwise promising
project uneconomical. Fig. 5 shows the sensitivity of the auxiliary
pumping power as a function of the permeability of the reservoir
based on the existing ※Cockburn 1§ well located in the Perth Metropol-
itan Area, Australia.
The conventional practice of assuming pre-set, xed well eld pa-
rameters (or even ※typical§ pumping power data as adopted from differ-
ent projects) commonly found in techno-economic studies for
geothermal desalination is very prone to erroneous estimates for the
pumping power, potentially putting the entire project at risk.
In this paper, we have included this crucial auxiliary pumping power
in our analyses. This has been done by adopting a facile hydrogeological
pumping model [35,41,49,50]. For the present example in Western Aus-
tralia, the model has been validated against operational data to within
㊣ 10% from a local geothermal system (Fig. A.2). The detailed validation
can be found in Appendix A.
In this model, in addition to assuming a homogeneous permeability
of the aquifer, we assume a horizontally isothermal behaviour, and ne-
glect variations of the aquifer temperature over the well lifetime by ap-
plying an average temperature prole.
The wellhead pressure pw that determines the pumping data for the
production pump can be expressed as [35]

2.2. Expenditures of the geothermal system

2.2.1. Capital expenditures of the geothermal system, Ccap , GEO
A major aspect in the economic feasibility of deep geothermal sys-
tems is related to the development of the geothermal well eld. Due
to the infancy of the industry and the geological uncertainty associated
with drilling at specic sites, ascertaining these well costs tend to be
very challenging [41].
Besides technical reasons, e.g. varying diameters, lithology, un-
planned events occurred during the well preparation process [42], the
prevailing situation of the oil and gas market, availability of drilling rigs
as well as geographical position of the well eld are regarded as main
drivers [43]. Importantly, in areas where advantageous geological condi-
tions require only drilling depths shallower than 2000 m, smaller drilling
rigs commonly used for water wells may be used. This can signicantly
reduce drilling costs to as low as 1000 US$ per meter [41,44].
The annualised capital cost of the geothermal well eld, following
from Eq. (6), can be expressed as:

The actual required well depth is determined by the average tem-
perature of the aquifer at extraction depth. In conduction dominated
reservoirs, this temperature can be estimated by the local average geo-
thermal gradient. Where advantageous uid ows are present, signi-
cantly increased temperatures can be encountered [45,46], thereby
signicantly reducing the required well depth.
Inevitably, the hot geothermal uid has to pass colder layers en route
to the surface, thereby resulting in heat losses along the well. As an ap-
proximation, the losses can be considered as a xed depth related value
as shown in Table 1.
Also, further capital expenditures related to the geothermal system,
including the production and reinjection pumps [47,48] and the infra-
structure preparation, which is location and application dependent,
need to be considered. Exemplary gures are also included in Table 1.

capital costs of the wells annually [52]. The main consideration here is
to ensure that the aboveground geothermal loop is leak free, since any
oxygen ingress or pressure drop may cause fouling and extra mainte-
nance. To this end, we consider an aboveground overpressure of 5 bar
as in Table 1 below. While the operation conditions can be variable, it
is a good practice to factor in maintenance operations every seven
years such as air lifting scalings on the drillhole screens and back ush-
ing the heat exchanger. This can be monitored by the pumping pressure
requirement.
Consequently, the total operational expenditures of the geothermal
system can be expressed as:

tem in order to maintain a stable operation as well as to avoid excessive

The properties of the geothermal uid are approximated as a func-

Additional operational costs of the geothermal wells are included as
maintenance cost, Cmaint , GEO. While the wells demand only minimal care
during regular operation, over the lifetime of the eld unexpected issues
can arise that can involve costly treatment (e.g. scaling or corrosion of
the casing [32,35]). To cover such possibilities, we consider 1% of the

The expected freshwater production rate, as well as the required
heat exchanger surface area used for the capital cost estimation, are
based on the detailed and validated thermodynamic optimisation
model introduced in detail in [30,31]. For this model, which is partly
adopted from El-Dessouky and Ettouney et al. [53每55] and has been val-
idated against operational data from the pilot plant [30], the following
standard engineering approximations are applied [56]:
← Steady state operation.
← Distillate is pure water.
← No sub-cooling of the distillate occurs in the effects.
← Losses due to Non-Equilibrium Allowance (NEA) and pressure drops
from the demister etc. are negligible.
← Energy losses to the environment are negligible.

For the optimisation of geothermal heat applications, only the
cooling water temperature, feed salinity, minimal allowable tempera-
ture differential over the effects, top brine temperature and recovery
ratio are used as input parameters. The temperature, specic heat ca-
pacity and available mass ow rate of the heating medium input and
output temperature are considered in tandem with the geothermal
module, whereas for example the number of effects, and temperature
gradient across the effects remain as independent variables.

3. Exemplary techno-economic analysis for Western Australia

Based on these considerations the techno-economic analysis is per-
formed for Western Australia. As reference for the economic data like

3.1. Geothermal potential

In Western Australia, there are eight sedimentary basins with on-
shore components (Fig. 6), of which the Canning, Carnarvon, Ofcer
and Perth Basins are deep enough to have temperatures above 60 ∼C
[57].
Geothermal investigations that have been performed in this area
since 1950s [37,57每66] conclude that higher temperature applications
are viable in the North Perth Basin and Western Canning Basin, while
good reservoir properties for low-enthalpy applications requiring high
ow rates are also found in the South Perth Basin, Carnarvon Basin, Of-
cer Basin, and Western Canning Basin. Fig. 7 juxtaposes the geothermal
prospects across Western Australia with local population densities.
We undertake an exemplar case study in the Northern Perth Basin
for the regional Centre of Geraldton. The City of Geraldton is located
400 km north of Perth and has a population of around 37,000 [67]. It
borders between a Mediterranean and semi-arid climate [68]. A sub-
stantial portion of the city's water demand is covered by groundwater
bores screened in the shallower areas of the Yarragadee Formation, at
about 50 km south of the city and near the town of Dongarra [69].
These well elds service also the water supply of the nearby towns of
Port Denison, Walkaway, Dongarra, and Narngulu [70]. The population
increase in this region is well over the Australian average, and for
Geraldton a potentially doubling in population is anticipated until
2020 [67,69]. Beside the signicant increase in demand, relatively high
bore water salinities with a temporal increasing tendency due to salt-
water intrusions is a major water issue [69].

ities of several wells in the broader area within the North Perth Basin

qualities have been reported in this area; but the co-location of highly
permeable rocks and reservoir or rock formation at which high temper-
atures are measured is somewhat uncertain [57]. Also some uncertainty
is typically associated with the borehole temperatures. However the
available data do provide a very good estimation of the geothermal pa-
rameters needed.
On account of the relatively high salinities as per Table 1 below,
SS316 is typically selected as the casing material for the wells.

3.2. Input parameter

Due to various reasons, including high wages, and geographical re-
moteness, several cost parameters stemming from generic global
datasets have to be adjusted to reect the local conditions:

3.2.1. Well eld development
There are no deep geothermal wells in Western Australia and only a
very small number of suitable rotary rigs have been employed in Austra-
lia [72]. For projects outside the major metropolitan areas, the well eld
development cost using conventional rigs employed in the oil and gas
industry is estimated to be three times that of the international average.
Among other reasons, this is due to the competing demand from the oil
and gas sites of those suitable rigs that are already low in supply [72].
Alternatively, locally available smaller rigs, typically used for water
wells and shallower geothermal projects can offer a solution for this
issue, provided the regulatory framework is addressed. Technically,
some of the rigs are capable of drilling at the present lithology to as
deep as 2000 m [44]. Based on experience with shallower geothermal
projects in the Perth Metropolitan Area, well costs for these systems
are estimated at 1300 AUD per meter [41,44]. This is the technology
that we are adopting in this study.

3.2.2. Desalination plant
A similar situation applies to the capital expenditures of desalination
plants. The capital costs of recent large scale RO plants in Australia have
been two to four times above the estimations based on international
data [73]. A number of factors have been cited for this escalating cost
[73,74].
including: (1) The emergency response nature of most
Australian municipal SWRO projects resulting in ＆crisis prices＊ for the
construction of those plants, (2) The political imperative to offset at

least part of the carbon footprint by acquiring Renewable Energy Credits
equivalent to the power consumption of the plant thereby involving ad-
ditional capital expenditure, and (3) relatively high wage rates for desa-
lination project construction workers in Australia. Apart from the high
wage rates, which is by far the most important factor, most of these is-
sues, only partially apply to smaller sized (up to ~ 5000 m3/day), renew-
able energy driven systems, thereby resulting in an escalation factor
that is far more subdued that those encountered in large RO plants for
these signicantly smaller MED units. A larger degree of prefabrication
and standardisation can therefore be expected, thereby dampening
the magnitude of increase. Consequently, an estimated increase of 20%
above the global average has been considered for the capital cost of
the MED plants in this study. This has been independently benchmarked
against quotations solicited in-condence from reputable suppliers.

3.2.3. Labour cost
The average annual cost for a skilled employee in the water industry
in Australia is 97,900 AUD/year [75]. For remote locations and applica-
tions proximate to mine sites, employment costs well above the
Australian average can be expected.

3.2.4. Electric power
The Australian electricity prices are among the highest in developed
countries [76]. Areas without access to the power grid have to endure
even signicantly higher electricity costs and/or load limitations.

3.3. General input parameters

As general input parameters for the analysis, the data as presented in
Tables 1 to 3 have been considered.

3.4. Results

Based on the above parameters and the geothermal parameters as in
Fig. 8, the estimated water costs for different target depths, viz. 1500 m,
1800 m and 2200 m derived from the techno-economic model are pre-
sented in Table 4.
The estimated cost of water ranges from 2.60 AUD/m3 for
the shallower depths characterised by higher permeabilities, to
1.89 AUD/m3 at around 1800 m. Due to the decrease in permeability,
deeper systems again show an increasing cost of water, rendering sys-
tems deeper than 2200 m not realistic at this location. The comparison
between conventional MED and the Preheated Boosted MED (PB-MED)
systems reveals that the latter can reduce the levelised cost of water
by 16% over the surveyed application range. The same comparison be-
tween the PB-MED and B-MED over the surveyed application range
shows a 5% reduction in the levelised cost of water. The additional initial
investment for both B-MED and PB-MED systems is higher than the con-
ventional MED plant, mainly due to the additional booster effect and
heat exchanger surface area. However as a whole both systems reduce
the water price signicantly.
The main drivers for this cost reduction by the Boosted and Preheated
Boosted MED are (1) the increased freshwater yield stemming from the
improved utilisation of the geothermal uid and (2) reduced well eld
expenses due to a shallower re-injection well.

Table 4
Results for different target depths 每 MED, B-MED and PB-MED.

Over the examined application range for the regional Centre of
Geraldton, the Preheated Boosted MED system as applied to a well eld
with an 1800 m deep production well is the most economic congura-
tion. This conguration is therefore used as the basis for further para-
metric studies.
Fig. 9 shows a breakdown of the various costs for both conventional
and Preheated Boosted MED systems. The geothermal system related ex-
penditures (CAPEX and OPEX) contribute approximately 45% to the
nal water cost. This is well within the typical range of energy related
cost contribution to conventional desalination systems. One major dif-
ference however is that in contrast to conventional fossil fuel driven sys-
tems, where the energy costs primarily occur as ongoing fuel/energy
expenditures, in the geothermal systems over 50% of that share incurs
upfront.
The largest uncertainties of this base case scenario are related to the
geothermal parameters, in particular the ow rate and the reservoir
permeability. In the absence of exact data for these parameters prior
to the well eld development, only estimations are possible. Fig. 10 il-
lustrates the respective impact of permeability and ow rate on water
cost for the three systems.
The ow rate of the hot geothermal uid is linearly related to the ex-
tractable energy at the surface. Within the application range the well
costs are predominantly a function of well depth, rather than well diam-
eter. Lower geothermal ow rates translate directly to a reduced fresh-
water production at an ostensibly unaltered capital cost. The immediate
consequence is an increased specic water cost, as encountered in
Fig. 10. This correlation is of particular interest, as in fact most often
the actual geothermal ow rates remains unknown until a relatively
late project stage of the well eld development.
A similar situation applies to the permeability, which is directly re-
lated to the pumping costs for the geothermal system. At permeabilities
beyond 0.3 Darcy, its inuence on the overall water costs remains rela-
tively stable. However, where lower permeabilities are encountered,
the exponentially increasing power consumption enjoins a correspond-
ing rise in operational cost for the well system, and consequently esca-
lating water costs.
Fig. 11 depicts the sensitivity of further key parameters on the spe-
cic water cost in relation to the base case scenario. Besides the inu-
ence of ow rate, permeability, and geothermal gradient, the water

price is expectedly very sensitive to the well eld completion costs. Im-
portantly due to the relatively high capital cost component, the specic
water cost is very sensitive to the discount rate. This is particularly im-
portant for the cross-comparison with other published cost estimates,
as a broad range of discount rates can be found in the literature
(Table 5).

3.5. Discussion

Regarding the specic water costs, these gures have to be meaning-
fully benchmarked against those of alternative water sources, and other
desalinations systems.
A reasonable comparison with alternative sources of water can be
achieved by the current direct water costs in the area. Beyond the
water scheme supplying the Perth Metropolitan Area and nearby re-
gions, including the Goldelds, very high water costs can be encoun-
tered. Especially for remote and often smaller communities, water
costs over 6 AUD/m3 and even in excess of 25 AUD/m3 have been re-
ported [84,85] (Fig. 12).

The actual direct water production costs are not generally disclosed
from the supply companies and due to the regulated water pricing struc-
ture, no direct relation between the actual local production costs and the
water price can be drawn. The latest publicly available data for Geraldton
and Dongarra, dating from 2006, however reveal a local direct cost of
1.45 AUD/m3 [85]. Depending on the applied consumer price index, this
would translate to 1.76 AUD/m3 (Perth specic CPI) or 2.61 AUD/m3
(Australian water supply and sewage specic CPI) in the reference year
2013.
Table 6 lists a collection of Australian specic water costs of various
desalination technologies for comparison, while Table 7 provides an
overview of some cost estimates of renewable energy driven desalina-
tion technologies.
Comparing the results of the techno-economic model on a general
scale against the levelised cost of alternative renewable energy driven
desalination technologies (Table 7), the surveyed geothermal desalina-
tion based on the Preheated Boosted MED is well within an economically
competitive range. Depending on the local geological conditions, it can
therefore represent the most favourable, renewable energy driven fresh-
water supply. For the present case study, for example, with levelised cost

4. Conclusion

A techno-economic analysis that explicitly includes the sub-surface
system has been undertaken to assess the potential of low-enthalpy
geothermal resources for desalination in Western Australia. Simulation
modules validated by actual experimental data via a local geothermal
system and a Boosted MED pilot plant were integrated to arrive at a
robust analysis.

For the surveyed application in the Western Australia Northern
Perth Basin, it is demonstrated that competitive levelised water costs
on the order of 1.56 to 2.52 A$/m3 can be achieved. A comparison
among conventional MED, the Boosted MED and the Preheated Boosted
MED technology highlights the importance of maintaining an increased
energy extraction from the geothermal source, thereby resulting in a re-
duction of the levelised unit cost on the order of 13 to 16%.
Over the surveyed application range (namely 1500, 1800 and
2200 m as target depths), a location specic optimal target depth exists
at 1800 m, where the geothermal parameters, namely wellhead tem-
perature and permeability, provide the economically best match to the
desalination system. The levelised cost of water at this target depth is
in the range of 5 to 15% lower in comparison with the other surveyed
target depths for all the considered desalination technologies, namely,
MED, B-MED and PB-MED. Concomitantly, at this condition, the geo-
thermal-system related expenditures (capital and operational) contrib-
ute approximately 45% to the nal water cost, which is well within the
typical range of energy related cost contribution to conventional desali-
nation systems. In this scenario, the PB-MED results in the lowest
levelised cost of water (1.89 A$/m3) among the various technologies.
In addition the pivotal importance of the geothermal uid ow rate
has been identied and shown that an increment of around 67% in the
geothermal uid ow rate (from 75 to 125 kg/s) reduces the levelised

cost of water by 20 to 25% for the various considered discount rates
and applies equally to all of the considered desalination technologies.
Benchmarked against both the levelised cost of water for existing
sources and alternative desalination technologies, geothermal desalina-
tion based on both Boosted and Preheated Boosted MED technologies can
provide an economically and technically viable freshwater supply solu-
tion with a small environmental footprint.

used for the validation of the geothermal pumping model.

Appendix A. Validation of the hydrogeological pumping model

The pumping model is validated based on data collected from the
largest low temperature geothermal heating system in Australia, locat-
ed at the HBF Stadium, known previously as the Perth Challenge Stadi-
um [95].
The HBF Stadium is the biggest purpose built outdoor aquatic centre
in the Southern Hemisphere. A geothermal system is utilised to heat its
three outdoor and two indoor pools with a total water volume of 11
million litres, as well as to preheat the changing room showers [36,95].
The geothermal system of the HBF Stadium accesses ~ 41 ∼C hot geo-
thermal uid in the Yarragadee Formation - the same formation within
the same Perth Basin which the present case study is targeting. This hot
water is passed through separate heat exchangers for the different
pools/showers, and returned at ~ 25每30 ∼C into the aquifer. Fig. A.1
depicts a schematic of the well eld. A variable speed pump is installed
to maintain the requisite ow rate, so as to track the heating
requirements of the different pools.
Fig. A.1 Schematic of the HBF Stadium well eld, based on [95,96].

To validate the pumping model, system operational data were col-
lected at varying operational modes. The volumetric ow rate, input
and output temperatures, differential pressure of the aboveground sys-
tem, and the actual pumping load of the variable speed pumps were
logged in fteen-minute intervals. The system design parameters
were gleaned from the system manual [96], and supplementary geolog-
ical information was obtained from the proximate St. Hilda's Anglican
School for Girls well eld (Table A.1).
The actual operational ow rate ranged between 8 and 25 l/s, with a
typical operational range between 14 and 18 l/s. The geothermal input
temperature ranges between 40.6 and 40.9 ∼C, with the uctuations of
which being in the accuracy range of the temperature sensor. The rein-

Waste heat performance ratio as in Eq. (C.1) [28], is used instead
which encourages the maximal use of the enthalpy of the low grade
heat source relative to the heat sink:

In the above equation 2326 kJ/kg is considered as the enthalpy of
distillation.
It should be noted that the conventional performance ratio (Eq. C.2)
which holds that heat comes with a premium as it is consumed, cannot
capture the essence of such low grade heat driven desalination systems
that only attracts a one-off investment cost, other than pumping power
[28]. As shown in Table C.1 its trend is incongruent with that of the
levelised water costs (Table 4). One can refer to [28] for more details re-
garding the issue pertaining to performance ratio in low grade heat
driven desalination systems.
