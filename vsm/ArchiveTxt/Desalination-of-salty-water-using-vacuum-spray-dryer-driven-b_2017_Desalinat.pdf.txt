abstract

This paper addresses evaporation under vacuum condition with the aid from solar energy and the recovered
waste heat from the vacuum pump. It is a preliminary attempt to design an innovative solar-based evaporation
system under vacuum. The design details, equipment required, theoretical background and work methodology
are covered in this article. Theoretically, based on the energy provided by the sun during the day, the production
rate of pure water can be around 15 kg/m2/day. Assumptions were made for the worst case scenario where only
30% of the latent heat of evaporation is recycled and the ability of the dark droplet to absorb sun energy is around
50%. Both the waste heat from the pump and the heat collected from the photovoltaic (PV) panels are proposed to
raise the temperature of the inlet water to the system to its boiling point at the selected reduced pressure.

1. Introduction

Water and energy are fundamental necessities for life on Earth
and to sustain the modern world . In many parts of the world , the
control and exploitation of water and energy has driven economic
deve lopment . In many other places there are shortages in fresh
water and energy supp l ies . Dr ink ing water of acceptable qua l ity
has become a scarce commodity not to mention unevenly distributed
geographically worldwide [14,24] . The World Health Organization
(WHO) has estimated that lack access to drinking water may be an
issue for more than a billion people [15]. The vast majority of these
people are from undeveloped countries and/or living in rural areas
where there is low popu lat ion dens ity . In remote locat ions it is
very difcult and costly to install conventional clean water solutions,
[25]. In many countries where there are shortages of clean and fresh
water, there are many other water resources that have potential to
be transformed. Such resources seawater, brackish/saline or contam-
inated groundwater , and coal seam gas water [26] . These kinds of
water require an innovative technique of treatment that uses sus-
tainable and low cost energy to produce clean water.
Desalination of saline water is known to be one of the most sus-
tainable alternative solutions to provide fresh water. This resource
can play a signicant role in soc ioeconomic development in many
deve lop ing countr ies such as Afr ica , Pac ic As ia and countr ies in
the Middle East [16] and Latin America. Desalination is a process in
which sal ine water is separated into two parts: one that has a low
concentration of dissolved salts (fresh water), and the other which
has a much higher concentration of dissolved salts than the original
feed water (brine concentrate), [27]. Reverse Osmosis (RO), a con-
ventional desalination technology, produces brine (70®C55% of intake
ow) depending of feed water quality; the dissolved salt concentra-
tion of the brine varies from 50 to 75 g/L resulting in a much higher
dens ity than seawater (Hamawand et a l . , 2013) . Desa l inat ion o f
salty water/seawater is expensive, mostly because of the energy re-
qu ired [17] . However , desa l ination is a growing eld around the
world where the needs for drinkable water are crucial [2]. All con-
ventional seawater desalination techniques such as RO, thermal dis-
t i l lat ion such as mu lt i stage ash (MSF) , electro-d ia lys is , or the ir
combinations consume a large amount of energy and they do not re-
cover the salt eventually. These techniques may also cause air pollu-
tion due to the large consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels
[19 ,20] . Furthermore , the br ine rema ins from these processes are
huge and represent another potential environmental problem [18].
There is a potential for using algae to clean the water after amending
it with some chemicals, however this has not been carried out exper-
imentally [11]. Therefore, the utilization of renewable energy can be
considered as one of energy sources of seawater desalination [3 ,5 ,
17].
A complete separation of salt from salty water is something that
cannot be achieved by many of the conventional methods. One con-
ventional, most efcient and reliable method for complete separa-
tion is evaporation . Evaporation of water at atmospheric pressure
requires large amounts of energy to raise the water temperature to
the boiling point. In addition, at atmospheric pressure the evapora-
tion rate is slow unless more vigorous heat is supplied. This problem
can be overcome by carrying out the evaporation under reduced
pressure where water can be evaporated at temperatures below its
atmospher ic pressure bo i l ing po int . Water evaporat ion under re-
duced pressure is energy efcient according to the laws of thermody-
namics, and can be driven by low-grade thermal energy sources such
as solar heat or process waste heat. While the evaporation under re-
duced pressure wi ll acce lerate the evaporat ion rate , one must be
concerned with potent ia l freez ing prob lems [4] . Heat is requ ired
for water droplets to evaporate, heat is provided from the surround-
ing. Without supplemental heat there is a risk that the equipment
parts get chilled and the remaining droplets freeze [1]. Carey et al.
[21] conducted experiments under contract to NASA related to evap-
oration of water under vacuum. The set up consisted of 0.6 m3 envi-
ronmental vacuum chamber and a 250 mL beaker with 25 mL o f
liquid water at a temperature of 20 °„C. The liquid took approximately
150 min to evaporate under reduced pressure of 0.38 kPa. In this ex-
periment no external heat was provided neither to the liquid or the
chamber.
Valuable information on desalination of seawater using solar en-
ergy has been reported, however, the desalination of sea water using
vacuum spray dryer has not been fully elucidated . This study pre-
sents an innovative design for evaporation of water using renewable
energy from the sun and recycles the latent heat of evaporation. Also
the waste heat from the pumps and collected heat from PV panels
that provide the pump with electricity are suggested as another
source of energy [7,8].

2. Theory

Water such as concentrated salty water produced from other
desalination processes such as RO process, brackish/saline groundwater

and/or seawater can be sprayed inside a double walled glass column
(evaporation column) exposed to sun light, Fig. 1. The double walled
co lumn w i l l reta in the heat ins ide the column and a l low a fu l l
exposure to sun l ight . The column will be operated under reduced
pressure to lower the water boiling point temperature. The generat-
ed vapour wil l condense on the ch il led column (condensat ion
co lumn) attached to the doub le g lass ing evaporat ion co lumn as
shown in Fig . 1 . This will allow the recovery of the energy ( latent
heat of evaporation) used to evaporate the water. After evaporating
the water , the salt will end up at the bottom of the double wa lled
column as pure dry salt.
A dark wa te r so lub le dye w i l l be d isso lved in the sa l ty wa te r
be fore be ing introduced to the system to enhance its absorpt ion
o f the sun l igh t . Sun l ight reec ted o r abso rbed sun l igh t by an
aeroso l depends p r imar i ly on the compos i t ion and co lour o f the
par t ic les d is so lved in i t . In gene ra l , br igh t -co lou red / t rans lucen t
particles tend to reect radiation in all directions and darker aero-
sols can absorb signicant amounts of light [12] . Dark blue to black
surfaces can absorb so lar rad iat ion to an approx imate fract ion of
0 .8 to 0 .9 o f the inc ident rad ia t ion . A s tudy by Ga ry e t a l . [13 ] ,
showed tha t d ispe rsed ca rbon b lack dus t o f s ize b 0 .1 ¶Ãm can
absorb solar energy as high as 5124 .4 J/g/s (2 °¡ 1010 ca l Ib 1 per
10 h).
The heat required for the evaporation of the water droplets can
be suppl ied/recovered from the fol lowing sources and sect ions in
the process (Fig. 1); sun light, double walled insulated glassing ef-
fect, black colour effect, heat generated by the vacuum pump, heat
co l lec ted f rom the PV pane ls and la tent hea t recove red from the
gene rated vapour . The pump can run on so lar energy us ing so lar
PV cells.
The evaporation process will be carried out under reduced pres-
sure , in other words , this means that there will be a very small
amount of a ir in the co lumn . The water drop let w i l l be released
very close to the one of the opposite walls inside the middle column,
to be specic it will be released next to the wall which is farther away
from the sun light. This will create a smaller laminar sub-layer at that
wall and will result in a higher heat transfer coefcient in compari-
son to the opposite wal l. The fast fall ing of the droplet next to the
wall will produce vortices ( in the evaporated vapour) and turbu-
lence wh ich lead to reduct ion of the lam inar sub- layer th ickness ,
Fig. 2.
Water evaporates at a specic temperature at a specic pressure,
in this design there will be three zones. The rst zone is the double
wall glassing that faces the sun l ight , the pressure inside this end-
closed column will be above the atmospheric and the temperature
is the highest among the whole system because it is facing the sun
light. The second zone is the middle column, the pressure is below
atmospheric and the temperature is almost as the same as or slightly
lower than room temperature (depending on the number of droplets
evaporated). The lower temperature is due to proximity of the vacu-
um pump and droplet evaporation. This zone can also be maintained
at higher than the droplet boiling point temperature (under vacu-
um) if the number of the droplets is maintained in balance with the
energy introduced to the system. The last zone is the vapour channel,
the evaporated water from the droplets in the middle column now
transports to the outside driven by the vacuum pump. The pressure
inside this zone is the same as the middle column and the tempera-
ture is the lowest among the whole system. Inside this channel con-
densation may happen because the space available is smaller than
the middle column and it is closer to the droplet. The space available
inside the middle column is high enough to maintain almost con-
stant temperature. The front side is exposed to sun light while, the
other side of the wall where the vapour is transport driven by the
vacuum pump has lower space which makes the change in tempera-
ture more possible, and furthermore is furthest away from the sun
light.
3. Mathematical model

When a free water sur face is in contact with pure vapour , the
equilibrium rate of molecule transfer from vapour phase to the liquid
or from the liquid phase to the vapour is given by kinetic theory of
gases. When the system is not at equilibrium, the net rate of evapo-
ration or condensation per unit droplet surface area is governed by
mod ied Hertz-Knudsen equat ion [10 ,28] , rst proposed by Alty
1931 [29] . Maa [29] , stud ied the evaporation rate of different sol-
vents including water. This study by Maa showed that there is little

This means that the evaporation coefcient is unity and can be repre-

Eqs. (3) and (4) can be used to predict the time interval required
for the entire droplet to evaporate and the rate the droplet evapo-
rates . The rate of evaporation of the droplet is calculated from the
change in the radius of the droplet. The radius of the water receding

front is an indication for the amount of water evaporated from the
droplet's surface.
These equations assume that the droplet is entering the system at
the temperature of evaporation (depending on the system's pressure)
which means neglecting initial condensation is applicable. By introduc-
ing the waste heat from the vacuum pump, recycled latent heat of evap-
oration and heat collected from the PV panels, it is possible to introduce
the droplet to the system at its boiling point to avoid initial condensa-
tion phenomenon. The temperature of the droplet will remain constant
at its boiling point due to continuous evaporation while provided with
sufcient heat. Also, the saturation vapour pressure of the water droplet
will be constant based on Eq. (4). Furthermore, the vacuum pump is as-
sumed to be efcient and is able to keep the pressure inside the system
constant.
The evaporation will be dominated by the heat transfer from the
medium (mostly vapour) to the droplet plus that received directly
from the sun via radiation. For simplicity, at steady state conditions,
the medium receives energy from the sun which is transferred to the
droplet; the temperature of the medium is assumed to be constant
and slightly above the droplet temperature due to losing its heat to
the droplet via convection . Based on this assumption, the amount
of water evaporated is ca lculated to ma inta in these cond itions in
the system.

4. Simple scenario

Assume low vacuum pressure of 6.9 KPa, this means that the droplet
needs to enter the system at 38.7 °„C to start evaporating instantly (no
initial condensation).
The maximum amount of energy received from the sun in ideal cir-
cumstances is 1000 W/m2. Fig. 3 shows the energy received from the
sun per square meter on a clear day. The energy varies between 100
and 1000 W/m2 depending on time of day. The data for the actual ener-
gy received which is provided by the sun on a clear day was retrieved
from a book by Stine and Geyer [9], Fig. 3.
In this simple case, the recycled latent heat was not included in the
calculation which otherwise would enhance the system efciency. The
waste heat from the pump has been assumed to provide heat for the
droplet before entering the system to increase its temperature to the
boiling point along with piping system connected to the solar PV
panel if required. In this scenario, the system (medium, surroundings)
the temperature is assumed to be constant at 38.7 + 5 °„C (this is a rea-
sonable assumption under clear day and direct contact with the sun
light) and the extra temperature (heat) gained from the sun will be

used to evaporate the droplets. For a droplet of 3 mm diameter (0.014 g
weight), the model shows that it takes approximately 0.6 s to evaporate
(Fig. 4) the droplet. Furthermore, the height of the system required to
accommodate the 0.6 s time required for evaporation the droplets was
estimated. Based on the speed the droplet travels to reach the base of
the system, 3 m height column is required.
The results in Fig. 4 show that in order to evaporate one droplet
every 0.6 s, it is required to raise the temperature of the input water
to 38.7 °„C and the temperature of the medium (mostly vapour) where
the droplet travel to 38.7 + 5 °„C. It is assumed that the initial tempera-
ture of the water and the medium is 20 °„C. The energy required to raise
the temperature of the water to 38.7 °„C is; m °¡ Cp °¡ ¶§T =
0.00001413 kg °¡ 4.18 kJ/kg°§K °¡ (38.7  20) K = 1.104 J. As mentioned
previously the calculation is for 1 m2 area exposed to sun light; in case
the depth of the evaporation compartment is 0.3 m then the volume
occupied is 0.3 m3. However, since the system is under vacuum, con-
tinuous vapour is produced which a lso gains energy from the sun
and the walls of the compartment which later transfers to the drop-
let. The specic heat of water vapour at 43.7 °„C is 1.871 kJ/kg°§K and
the density at standard conditions is 0.804 kg/m3. To raise the tem-
perature of the med ium to 38 .7 + 5 °„C; m °¡ Cp °¡ ¶§T =
(0.804 °¡ 0.3) kg °¡ 1.871 kJ/kg°§K °¡ ((38.7 + 5)  20) K = 10.7 J of
energy is required. The total amount of energy required to maintain
the system at the condition assumed is 11 .8 J for evaporating one
droplet each 0.6 s. The sun provides an average 579 J/s (27.1 MJ/m2/-
day (13 h)) and the latent heat of evaporat ion requ ired is 34 .25 J
(2424 K J/kg °¡ 0 .01413 °¡ 10 3 kg) for each drop let each 0 .6 s .
A lso , in 0 .6 s , the water drop let m ixed w ith dark co lour is ab le
to absorb 43 .4 J [5124 .4 J/g/s (energy absorbed by 1 g black
carbon) °¡ 0.01413 g (droplet mass) °¡ 0.6 s]. This gain of energy con-
rms the possibility of providing the droplet with enough energy to
evaporate even only from the direct irradiation to the droplet. Based
on the data above, the mass of water that can be evaporated in this
system was calculated.
In this case the droplet obtains 10.7 J from the medium/recycled la-
tent heat/pump waste heat and/or the pipes connected to the solar sys-
tem. And 23.55 J (53% of the 43.4 J) absorbed directly from the sun; the
number of droplets that can be evaporated is around 16.9 droplets (579/
34.25) and the amount evaporated in one day (13 h) is 11.2 kg/m2/day
(16.9 °¡ 0.00001413 kg °¡ 13 h °¡ 3600 s). In case 30% of the latent heat of

evaporation has been recycled then 24.15 droplets (579/(34.25 °¡ 0.7))
can be evaporated and total amount of 15.9 kg per day is obtained. Fig. 5
shows the distribution of the mass of water that can be evaporated per
second during the day from 0600 to 2000. The maximum mass of water
that can be evaporated is around 4 g and 6 g which occurs around 0100
(middle of the day) when the maximum energy received from the sun
(1000 W/m2) for both cases, respectively.
In case that the temperature of the inlet water to the system rises
above 38.7 °„C and/or the temperature of the medium rises above
38.7 + 5 °„C then the time required for evaporation will reduce, see
Fig. 65. A high temperature condition will not impact the amount of
water evaporated because the received energy from the sun per second
is the same as the previous case. It is very important then to balance the
energy received from the sun (plus the recycled latent heat and waste
energy) with the droplet size and the time of evaporation to avoid freez-
ing the system.

5. Methodology, challenges and feasibility

5.1. Methodology

The experimental evaluation will be carried out as following;
 Empty column evaluation: estimate the heat accumulation in a one
square meter area system with time.
 The water can be heated to a variety of temperatures prior to spread-
ing in the spray column; this will help to indicate the optimum tem-
perature of the water and at the same time help to evaluate the
efciency of using the waste heat from the vacuum pump.
 The variables that should be considered in regards to the droplet will
be: size, colour, residence time, temperature and salt concentration.
 Measure the temperature inside the system at different heights and
widths.
 Wall temperatures inside and outside of the system, in addition to
the outdoor temperature.
 Measure the moisture content of the solid salt produced.

5.2. Sensors and equipment

The equipment required for building a lab-scale system includes the
following;
 Temperature sensors to monitor the temperature of the water inlet,
water produced, salt produced and inside the chamber. Also, sensors
to monitor the intensity of energy received from the sun.
 Vacuum pumps are able to maintain a constant and consistent re-
duced pressure up to 99.99% vacuum and high suction rates of up to
1200 m3/h is possible [22].

 Multi droplets system, it will be limited to a specic droplets num-
ber per cubic unit of space; exceeding this limit may lead to ex-
haust ion of the heat in that specic space and may lead to
freezing the entire system.
 The nozzle can be designed to release droplet at a specic reduced
pressure. Reduced pressure in the device can be kept at a specic
value but above that required for the nozzle to function. A pulse
vacuuming can be introduced to reduce the pressure in the device
to that required for the nozzle to function in order to release and
control the time and amount of the droplets release.

5.4. Feasibility

 The operation is at a low range vacuum condition. Vacuum ranges are
categorized as following: 3300®C100,000 Pa low, 0.1®C3300 pa medium
and 0.0001®C0.1 Pa high [23].
 Vacuum pumps such as Rotary Piston Mechanical Pump, Oil Sealed
Mechanical Pump, and Sorption Pump can be used to generate low
vacuum conditions [23].
 Thermal and high speed camera to monitor the temperature of the
droplet and its diameter while traveling through the system.
 Mon i to r the waste heat co l lected from the vacuum pump and
the co l lected heat by the heat exchanger attached to the so lar
panel.

 For a concentrated salty water of 50% dissolved salt, the ability of
water treatment will be doubled (half of the amount is required to
be evaporated).
 For more efcient use of the sun energy the amount of water pro-
duced per day may be increased.
 Including the recycled latent heat of evaporation, waste heat from the
pump and the droplet colour effect will all contribute in enhancing the
system efciency.

Fig. 7 shows a schematic diagram of an industrial scale system where
multi droplets are spread. Based on this design, two products can be re-
covered cold pure water and pure coloured salt.

5.3. Challenges

6. Other design option

 The nozzle should be very fast in spray ing the droplet to avo id
evaporation at its tip. This may block the nozzle either by the re-
ma ining salt after evaporation of the water or the droplet may
freeze at its tip.

The other des ign opt ion is a rotat ing b lack co loured conveyer
where the droplet sprayed over and travels instead of traveling in
the vacuum (most ly vapour) . In th is case the ent ire surface w i l l
collect the energy from the sun and will be transferred to the droplet
by conduction. The droplet will travel from one end of the conveyer

(Fig. 8).

 Thermal energy production via heat exchanger placed inside the

7. Innovative system for harvesting solar energy

Another option for the design of the system is a spherical closed en-
vironment. This system can be used to trap the sun light inside the sys-
tem. In case the system used for evaporation, mirrors attached to the
inside of the spherical shaped system (Fig. 9) are capable of reecting
the energy without losing it for more efcient energy collection and
more efcient evaporation.
In case the spherical system is used for collecting heat and electricity,
the system should covered with PV cells, this new shape allows more
exposed surface to the sun light with less footprint occupied. The solar
cells are protected against the weather disturbance and make better
use of the light.

Surface area created by a half sphere of 0.1 m diameter =
2¶–(0.05)2 m2 = 1.57 °¡ 10 2 m2
Surface area created by the 400 small half
400 °¡ 1.57 °¡ 10 2m2 = 6.28 m2
A complete closed sphere will:
 Protect the surface of the silicon cells from the weather condition
 Possibility of using a rough surface for more light absorbent, uncov-
ered cells/very low reection of light
 Creates 6.3 m2 for each 1 m2 of footprint
 Higher intensity of light inside the globe
 No escape of light entering the sphere
 Easy to control and direct toward the sun light

The system includes placing a large elliptical shaped sun light collec-
tor at the top of the sphere and then focuses it to the inside of the
sphere. A light spreader placed in the middle of the sphere will be re-
quired to spread the light inside the sphere space.
The energy prov ided by the sun dur ing a c lear day (Fig . 7) is
around 27.1 MJ/day/m2. If 50% this energy trapped in the spherical
system, then the amount of water that can be introduced to the
vacuum evaporator at 100 °„C can be around 40.5 kg/day or this can
be at lower amount but with higher temperature . This water rst
will be circulated in the spherical system (Fig. 8) to collect the energy
from the sun and it is based on 1 m2 surface area available for collecting
the sun energy;

This spherical collector will eliminate the initial condensation phe-
nomena in the vacuum system and at the same time provides extra en-
ergy to the vacuum system. Also, the solar panel inside the sphere will
provide electricity to drive the vacuum pump.

8. Conclusions

To conclude, the innovative approach and design presented in this
article shows a promising potential of more efcient use of solar desali-
nation when combined with vacuum action and waste heat/latent heat/
solar heat recycling. PV cells can be used to drive the vacuum pump in
the system. Around 15 kg/m2/day of pure water can be produced in ad-
dition to by-product salt. Spherical closed system that is capable of trap-
ping sun light will have a better efciency than an open design to collect
the heat and electricity from the sun light. In the vacuum system, it is
very important to keep balance between the received energy from the
sun, recycled latent heat, waste heat from the pump and the heat
collected from PV panel with the droplet size, number and speed of
traveling.
