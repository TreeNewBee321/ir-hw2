abstract 

Sparsity is a precondition for compressive data gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks. To solve the sparse 
representation problem of sensory data in temperature eld, the paper puts forward a diffusion wavelet 
basis algorithm, which mainly includes the construction of diffusion operator and the lter of diffusion 
wavelet bases. The construction of diffusion operator takes spatial correlation between sensory data and 
the communication radius into account. Diffusion wavelet bases are generated from diffusion wavelet 
trees with different decomposition levels. The algorithm introduces numerical sparsity to evaluate the 
sparsity of approximately sparse data. Based on the measure of sparsity, diffusion wavelet basis with 
the better performance is extracted as the sparsifying basis. Synthetic data experiment and real data ex- 
periment are conducted to validate the performance of the sparsifying basis. The results of numerical 
experiments show that sensory data are approximately sparse, and the numerical sparsity in the pro- 
posed diffusion wavelet basis is less than that in the other types of the sparsifying bases. The recovery of 
sensory data considers the noiseless and noise cases. When BP and BPDN are used for data recovery, and 
the measurement matrix is sparse binary matrix, we observe that the proposed diffusion wavelet basis 
decreases relative error.

1. Introduction 

Compressive sensing (CS) [1] provides a data gathering method 
for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [2] , and can use the fewer 
linear measurements to recover these data. Consider a WSN with 
N sensor nodes. Each sensor node has a random ID that ranges 
¡Ü i 
¡Ü N ) is denoted 
from 1 to N , and sensor node with ID i (1 
. The data readings of sensor nodes are a column vector 
x 
 where x i 
is data reading of s i 
. If x has 
a sparse representation in a basis 
 it is written as

N¡Á1 is the coecient vector of x , and

to k ( k 
many signals are approximately sparse in an appropriate basis. If 
(cid:6) N ) large coecients in a basis, and the coe- 
x only has k ( k 
cients sorted in decreasing order of magnitude decrease quickly, x 
is approximately k -sparse.

the l 1

contain Basis Pursuit(BP) [3] , IT(Iterative thresholding) [4] and etc. 
Due to the additive nature of radio waves in WSNs, the commu- 
nication receiver circuitry of sink node usually generates the noise 
[5] . The noisy measurement can be expressed as

where z represents the measurement noise (additive uncorrelated

Eq. (2) , the problem in Eq. (3) can be solved by the noisy version 
BPDN of BP. 
In compressive data gathering [6] , two factors to be considered 
are the sparsifying basis and the measurement matrix. The mea-

surement matrix includes dense random matrices and sparse ran- 
dom matrices [7] . Dense random matrices, such as independent 
and identically distributed Gaussian random matrix and Bernoulli 
matrix, satisfy RIP with overwhelming probability. However, the 
class of matrices have high computational complexity, which inter- 
feres with the hardware implementation [8] . Compared with them, 
sparse random matrices are sparser. For this kind of matrix, Wang 
et al. showed the performance of data recovery was comparable 
to the optimal k -term approximation [9] . Sparse binary matrix is 
in that category. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic 
and real data sets, Li and Qi showed the recovery accuracy of sen- 
sory data by sparse binary matrix outperformed existing sparse 
random matrices [10] . So sparse binary matrix is used for com- 
pressive data gathering and data recovery in the paper. 
Sparse representation of sensory data is rst to nd the spar- 
sifying basis of sensory data, and determine the coecient vector 
based on Eq. (1) . The goal of the paper is to construct the spar- 
sifying basis of temperature data in the monitored led. Because 
WSNs can be described by weighted graphs, and multiscale sig- 
nal processing technique based on diffusion wavelet can be lifted 
to the graph for compression and approximation [11] , diffusion 
wavelet is more attractive in this problem [12] . Diffusion wavelet 
applies a diffusion operator on the graph to a space of test func- 
tions at the nest scale, and uses its dyadic powers to induce a 
multiresolution analysis. Diffusion wavelet provides a paradigm of 
wavelet decomposition for multiscale analysis on graphs [13] . Xi- 
ang et al. [12] rst adopted diffusion wavelet to design the sparsi- 
fying basis of sensory data in WSNs, and the experimental results 
showed that diffusion wavelet had the better performance in the 
sparse representation of sensory data. Inspired by the construction 
of diffusion operator [12] , we study the effect factors of diffusion 
wavelet, and propose a diffusion wavelet basis algorithm. Based on 
the algorithm, we construct the sparsifying basis of sensory data, 
and use measure of sparsity to verify its performance. The main 
contributions of the paper are as follows. 

(1) In the paper, the temperature led monitored by a WSN is 
mapped into a graph. Based on graph theory and the deploy- 
ment of sensor nodes, we put forward a method to measure 
the spatial correlation of sensory data. This method uses the 
spatial correlation between sensory data as the weight of an 
edge on the graph, and generates the diffusion operator re- 
stricted by the communication radius. It has been proved by 
theoretical analyses and the experiment that high powers of 
the constructed diffusion operator have low numerical rank. 
(2) For approximately sparse temperature data in the sparsify- 
ing basis, we propose a diffusion wavelet basis algorithm to 
make temperature data sparser. In the algorithm, we intro- 
duce the numerical sparsity to evaluate the proportion of ef- 
fectively large coecients, and consider the decomposition 
level of diffusion wavelets for the optimization of the algo- 
rithm. 
(3) The synthetic data experiment and real data experiment are 
carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algo- 
rithm in the noiseless and noise cases. In addition, we com- 
pare the proposed diffusion wavelet basis with other sparsi- 
fying bases in terms of numerical sparsity and data recovery. 
From the experimental results, we can see that numerical 
sparsity is minimal in the proposed diffusion wavelet basis, 
and relative error of data recovery is the less. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we 
construct the diffusion operator based on WSNs described by the 
weighted graphs. In Section 3 , low numerical rank of high powers 
of diffusion operator is proved in theory. Given that premise, we 
propose the diffusion wavelet basis algorithm, and regard the basis 
as the sparsifying basis of sensory data. To verify the algorithm, 

synthetic data experiment and real data experiment are conducted 
in Section 4 . Section 5 concludes the paper. 

2. Diffusion wavelet based sparsity model 

In the section, we introduce the construction of diffusion oper- 
ator, which is the major part of sparsity model, and describe two 
estimation methods of the sparsifying basis: Gini Index( GI ) and nu- 
merical sparsity s .

Suppose sensor nodes are uniformly deployed to monitor a spa- 
tially varying temperature eld. The eld is regarded as an image 
with a degree of spatial correlation and sensory data correspond to 
the pixel values in the image [5] . In this case, the temperature eld 
being monitored can be mapped to a graph on two-dimensional 
plane. 
Network topology of a WSN is abstracted to a weighted undi- 
rected graph G ( V, E, 
¦Ø). It consists of a set of vertices V , a set 
¦Ø . V corresponds to nodes in 
of edges E and a weight function 
WSNs, that is, V 
 where s 0 
is sink node. For 
a general graph G ( V, E, 
¦Ø), if s i 
and s j 
can communicate with each 
other, an edge e ij 
¡Ü i 
exists, and the set of all edges is expressed as 
E 
 . The weight function 
 satises 
¡Ý 0. The weighted adjacency matrix of G ( V, E, 
and 
¦Ø) is 
, 
¦Ø), diffusion wavelet 
] . For sensory data dened on G ( V, E, 
is introduced to construct an orthogonal basis for functions sup- 
ported on the graph. The construction process of diffusion wavelet 
¦Ø) by analyzing the eigenvec- 
produces a basis tailored to G ( V, E, 
tors of diffusion operator O derived from weighted adjacency ma- 
trix. Based on the method in [12] , the paper denes the weight 
as a function of the spatial correlation between sensory data 
and s j 
.

Under the circumstances, the constructed G ( V, E, 
¦Ø) is used to denote the spatial correla- 
ferent meaning. G ( V, E, 
tion between sensory data of sensor nodes, and V not only in- 
cludes sensor nodes but also includes their sensory data. Unlike 
the method in [12] , the paper considers the communication radius 
R in weighted adjacency matrix 
. The communication radius R 
called in the communications networks is no longer to measure 
whether two sensor nodes can communicate with each other, and 
it is used to bound the degree of spatial correlation in the paper. 
In Eq. (4) , d ij 
is Euclidean distance between s i 
and s j 
. The smaller 
¡Ü R ) is, the larger the spatial correlation is. With 
the value of d ij 
the increase of d ij 
, the spatial correlation between sensory data of 
and s j 
becomes smaller and smaller. When the value of d ij 
is 
greater than R , spatial correlation between sensory data of s i 
and 
is set as zero. Compared with [12] , the denition in Eq. (4) weak- 
ens the spatial correlation of sensory data from two sensor nodes, 
which are far away from each other. The value of R is determined 
based on measure of sparsity and the geometric structure of sen- 
sory data, which will be introduced in Section 3 . 
In graph theory, degree matrix is combined with adjacency ma- 
trix to construct Laplacian matrix of a graph. Each entry in the de- 
gree matrix is the number of edges attached to the vertex. For the 
weighted undirected graph G ( V, E, 
¦Ø), degree matrix D considers 
spatial correlation between sensory data. Each entry in degree ma- 
trix D is D ij 
, dened in Eq. (5) . Normalized Laplacian matrix of G ( V, 
E, 
¦Ø) is

tion of degree matrix D in Eq. (5) can guarantee the spectral range

2.2. Measure of sparsity 

The sparsity k of x in the sparsifying basis 
 is usually mea- 
. For approximately sparse 
sured by l 0 
norm, k 
s.t. x 
data, only fewer large coecients concentrate a large proportion of 
energy. So we introduce Gini Index( GI ) [16,17] and numerical spar- 
sity [18] .

Gini Index( GI ) exhibits relative distribution of energy among the 
coecients. Seen from the denition in Eq. (7) , GI is normalized, 
and the value ranges from zero to one. The closer to one the value 
of GI is, the more concentrated the distribution of energy among 
these coecients is. Further, the basis, where GI of the coecients 
is the larger, can make x sparser. Considering the instability of 
in practical application, numerical sparsity was proposed as 
an alternative measure of sparsity [18] .

3.1. Description and analysis of algorithm 

If high powers of diffusion operator have low numerical rank, 
they can be compressed by projecting on an appropriate sub- 
space. Based on the assumption, Coifman and Maggioni [11] pro- 
posed the construction of diffusion wavelet tree. Enlightened by 
the approaches in [11,12] , we propose a diffusion wavelet basis 
Algorithm 1 .

According to the locations of sensor nodes, the algorithm rst 
calculates the maximum value d max of Euclidean distances among 
sensor nodes, and determines the minimum value R min 
to guaran- 
tee the network connectivity. From the construction of diffusion 
operator, we can see that different communication radius R can 
generate different diffusion operators. For each value of R , the cor- 
responding diffusion operator O is represented on the basis U 0 
, 
and its high powers have low numerical rank, which has been 
step24, a diffusion wavelet 
proved in Theorem 1 . Through step13 
tree is generated. The tree includes the orthogonal bases of dif- 
fusion scaling function U J and the orthogonal bases of wavelets 
V J . SpQR is a function of computing a sparse QR decomposition.

SpQR are available in [11] . Calculate the sparsity(numerical spar- 
sity) of sensory data, and repeat the above steps. Based on the 
sparsity(numerical sparsity), we determine diffusion wavelet basis 
with the better performance. From the foregoing, the proposed al- 
gorithm is to look for the optimal values of 
¦Á and 
¦Ã from a - 
nite set. Like greedy algorithm, it is dicult to prove the optimum 
mathematically, and the optimal values in the paper can be con- 
sidered to be locally optimal. 
The proposed algorithm requires the position information of 
sensor nodes to construct the diffusion operator. In a real sen- 
sor network, sink node gets these information by some localiza- 
tion techniques. Generally, the localization techniques of sensor 
nodes are categorized as the range-free and range-based. Range- 
free localization techniques utilize the radio connectivity to map 
the network topology, and the number of hops between two nodes 
is used as a distance metric [20] . Range-based localization tech- 
niques are to estimate the distance between two nodes, and com- 
pute the position of every node in the network. Compared with 
range-free localization techniques, range-based localization tech- 
niques are more accurate [21] . Range-based techniques include an- 
gle of arrival (AOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), and time 
of arrival (TOA) and received signal strength indication (RSSI) [22] . 
Such as GreenOrbs, a large-scale sensor network system deployed 
in a forest, [23] inherited the advantages of two localization tech- 
niques, and proposed a Combined and Differentiated Localization 
approach. When the higher accuracy is required, Global Position- 
ing System (GPS) could even be used in outdoor environments. 

3.2. Time complexity of algorithm 

,

+

The step 1 in the proposed algorithm is the calculation of Eu- 
clidean distance and determination of the maximum Euclidean dis- 
tance. Because the network includes N sensor nodes and one sink 
node, the time complexity is O 
((N 
 1)
 and O 
((N 
 1)
 log(N 
1))
 respectively. In steps 2¨C7, Prim algorithm is used to validate 
((N

the network connectivity, and the time complexity is O 
The construction of normalized Laplacian matrix only relates to 
2 ). Steps 13¨C24 are 
sensor nodes, and the time complexity is O ( N 
the generation of diffusion wavelet tree, and the time complexity 
is O ( N 
3 ) in the worst case. The last step is to calculate the spar- 
sity(numerical sparsity) of diffusion wavelet coecients, and the

time complexity is O ( N ). As a result, the time complexity of the 
proposed algorithm is O ( N 
3 ) in the worst case. Given the decom- 
¦Ã , [12] has the same order of magnitude as the pro- 
position level 
posed algorithm in the construction of diffusion wavelet tree, and 
3 ) in the worst case. However, the pro- 
the time complexity is O ( N 
posed algorithm adds to the steps 1¨C6, steps 25¨C28, and it needs 
to take more time to look for the optimal values of 
¦Á and 
¦Ã . Com- 
pared with [12] , the runtime of the proposed algorithm is longer. 

3.3. Sparse representation of sensory data 

According to the proposed algorithm, we construct a diffusion 
wavelet basis 
 with the better performance, and regard it as the 
sparsifying basis of x . If the data readings of sensor nodes are a 
column vector x 
 the coecient vector

As mentioned in the proposed algorithm, the numerical sparsity s

the coecient vector, and the linear representation of x in the 

is sparse. 

4. Experimental results and analysis 

4.1. Experiment setting 

In the section, we carry out the synthetic data experiment and 
real data experiment of temperature eld to demonstrate the pro- 
posed algorithm. Among them, the temperature eld in the syn- 
thetic data experiment is simulated by peaks function in MAT- 
LAB [24,25] . The temperature elds in real data experiment are 
from four scenarios: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- 
tration¡¯s National Weather Service [26] , temperature distribution in 
USA [27] , and Sea Surface Temperature(100 KM Global) [28] . These 
experiments are realized on the PC with inter(R) Core(TM) i3-3320 
CPU@3.30 GHz, and the experimental tool is MATLAB. Based on the 
approach in Section 2 , we rst construct the diffusion operator, and 
analyze the performance of numerical rank. Then represent sen- 
sory data in the proposed diffusion wavelet basis, and compare 
the sparsity(numerical sparsity) in different sparsifying bases. Fi- 
nally we consider the recovery performance of sensory data by BP 
in the noiseless case and that by BPDN in the noise case. In addi- 
tion, the proposed diffusion wavelet basis is compared with other 
sparsifying bases in terms of relative error. 

4.2. Analysis of diffusion operator 

,

Suppose N (1024) sensor nodes and one sink node are deployed 
¡Á 100 m 
in the area of 100 m 
 as shown in Fig. 1 . Sensor nodes 
obey the random uniform distribution, and their locations are 
known. Sink node is responsible for compressive data gathering 
and it is placed in the center (50,50) of the area. In the network, 
the maximum value of Euclidean distances between any two nodes 
is d max m . The communication radius R among two nodes is rst 
¡Á d max m and the network is connected. According to 
set as 0.1 
the approach in Section 2 , we construct the diffusion operator O 
¡Á N . The singular values are sorted in descend- 
with the size N 
ing order, as denoted in Fig. 2 (a). We observe that the scope of 
singular values is [0, 1], i.e. 
 [0, 1]. With the increase of pow- 
ers of diffusion operator O , the singular values decay quickly, and 
the value of numerical rank r reduces. When the value of 
4 and

4.3.1. Sparsity of sensory data 
According to the proposed algorithm, we dene 
¦Á range from 0.1 to 1.0 by the step size 0.1. Because the 
values of 
construction of diffusion operator O is affected by the communi- 
¦Á will generate different diffu- 
cation radius R , different values of 
¦Á , the temperature data are 
sion wavelet bases. For each value of 
represented in the corresponding diffusion wavelet basis. From the 
experiments, we discover that temperature data are approximately 
sparse in diffusion wavelet basis and record the numerical sparsity 
s . Based on these statistical data, Fig. 4 draws the relationship be- 
¦Á . In Fig. 4 , the step size of 
tween the numerical sparsity s and 
is 0.05 for the better observation. In addition, the effect of the de- 
¦Ã on the numerical sparsity s is also taken into 
composition level 
account. For different values of 
¦Ã , we observe from Fig. 4 that nu- 
¦Á is 
merical sparsity s has the minimum value when the value of 
¦Ã is 2. If the value of 
¦Ã is greater than 6, the 
0.1 and the value of 
condition in the step 14 of proposed algorithm is satised. In this 
¦Ã is greater 
case, diffusion wavelet basis, corresponding value of 
than 6, is the same as that corresponding value of 
¦Ã is 6, and the 
¦Ã . To verify the per- 
value of s doesn¡¯t change with the increase of 
formance of numerical sparsity s , the coecients of temperature 
data represented in diffusion wavelet basis are in descending order

by the magnitude, as denoted in Fig. 5 , where the value of 
When the value of 
¦Ã is 2, the magnitude of diffusion wavelet coef- 
cients has a more rapid decay, which corresponds to the smaller 
value of s in Fig. 4 . From the above analysis, one can draw a con- 
clusion that the minimum value of s is obtained when the value 
¦Á is 0.1 and the value of 
¦Ã is 2. In different diffusion wavelet 
of 
bases, the diffusion wavelet basis corresponding to the minimum 
value of s is better. When GI is used as the evaluation index, the 
¦Á is 0.1 and 
maximum value of GI is 0.8924. Here the value of 
the value of 
¦Ã is 6. To compare the difference between numeri- 
cal sparsity s and GI , Fig. 6 shows the diffusion wavelet coecients 
sorted in decreasing order by the magnitude. Meanwhile, the val- 
¦Á is 
ues of GI and s are summarized in Table 2 . When the value of 
0.1, the value of GI corresponding decomposition level 2(i.e. 
 2) 
is less than that corresponding decomposition level 6(i.e. 
 6).

are listed in Table 1 . Compared with the lower powers of diffusion 
operator O , the higher powers have the lower numerical rank r , 
which corresponds to Theorem 1 . For other values of R , the above 
steps are repeated and the same conclusion can also be drawn. 
Besides, Fig. 2 (b) and Table 1 also show the diffusion operator O 
constructed by [12] . We observe that the diffusion operator O in 
[12] has the smaller numerical rank r . 

4.3. Synthetic data experiment 

In the experiment, we use peaks function in MATLAB to simu- 
late the temperature eld [24,25] , as shown in Fig. 3 (a). Fig. 3 (b) 
depicts the temperature data of 1024 sensor nodes, and the tem- 
perature values are represented in different colors. In the proposed 
¦Ã and 
algorithm, the maximum value of the decomposition level 
the value of 
 are set as 8 and 10 
 respectively.

This is because GI and numerical sparsity s have different focus. 
GI denotes relative distribution of energy among these coecients, 
but numerical sparsity s represents the number of effectively large 
coecients. The paper is to use large coecients to solve the spar- 
sity problem of sensory data in the sparsifying basis. By contrast, 
numerical sparsity is a more appropriate choice. If the value of 
¦Ã is the same as that in [12] , 
is 1.0 and the decomposition level 
the constructed diffusion wavelet basis is the same as that in [12] . 
As can be seen from Table 2 , the value of s in the proposed algo- 
rithm is 33.8886 and the value of s in [12] is 59.3483 when the 
¦Ã is 2. If the value of 
¦Á is 0.1 and the value of 
¦Ã is the 
value of 
same as that in [12] , the value of s in the proposed algorithm is 
¦Á and 
¦Ã , Fig. 6 shows 
less than that in [12] . For different values of 
the change of diffusion wavelet coecients sorted in decreasing 
order by the magnitude. From Fig. 6 , we can see that diffusion 
wavelet coecients corresponding to the smaller value of s atten- 
uate quickly. 
To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the con- 
structed diffusion wavelet basis is compared with seven sparsify- 
ing bases (i.e. spatial basis(identity matrix), Discrete Cosine Trans- 
formation(DCT) basis, Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) basis, haar 
wavelet basis, bior3.1 wavelet basis, dictionary obtained by K-SVD 
[29] and diffusion wavelet basis [12] ) [30] . Numerical experimen- 
tal results are listed in Table 3 , where the value of 
¦Ã is 6. It can be 
seen that numerical sparsity s reaches the minimum value 51.9474 
when the sparsifying basis is diffusion wavelet basis in the paper. 
The value of s in DFT basis is maximal, and GI reaches the min- 
imum value 0.2906. The numerical sparsity s of the temperature 
data in spatial basis is 344.3421. DCT basis, DFT basis, haar wavelet

basis, and dictionary obtained by K-SVD can¡¯t make the temper- 
ature data sparser than the spatial basis. Their performances are 
worse in terms of numerical sparsity s . Compared with them, the 
numerical sparsity s in bior3.1 wavelet basis reduces to 289.1851. 
In these sparsifying bases above, diffusion wavelet basis in the pa- 
per can make the value of s smaller. As mentioned in Measure of 
Sparsity , the smaller the value of s is, the sparser sensory data in 
the sparsifying basis are. Therefore, the temperature data are the 
sparser in diffusion wavelet basis. Fig. 7 shows the coecients of 
temperature data represented in eight sparsifying bases. We can 
see that attenuation velocity of the coecients in diffusion wavelet 
basis is much faster. 

4.3.2. Recovery of sensory data 
From Eqs. (2) and (3) , we know that recovery of sensory data 
needs to consider the measurement matrix and the sparsifying ba- 
sis. Sparse binary matrix with a xed number of nonzero entries 
in each column satises RIP-1. Such matrices have a one-to-one 
correspondence with the adjacency matrices of xed left degree 
expander graph [31] . In the experiment, the measurement matrix 
 is sparse binary matrix with 8 ones in each column, and the 
 is the sparsifying basis mentioned above. The 
sparsifying basis 
coherence between 
 and 
 is

bound the minimum value M min

tee recovery performance of sensory data, the value of M should be 
greater than or equal to M min 
. Once the value of M is determined, 
sink node takes charge of collecting the measurements. 
For WSNs, the measurements are gathered by compressive data 
gathering algorithms [12,33¨C35] , which are beyond the scope of 
the paper. Generally speaking, in each measurement, the weighed 
sums of random projections(the product of sensory data and the 
corresponding entries in sparse binary matrix) are transmitted to 
sink node based on compressive data gathering algorithms. After 
M measurements, sink node collects the measurement vector y of 
¡Á 1, and recovers these data by BP or BPDN. Relative

As listed in Table 2 , diffusion wavelet basis with the better per- 
¦Á is 0.1 and the value of

¦Ã is 2. In the diffusion wavelet basis, the numerical sparsity s of 
temperature data is 33.8886. According to Eq. (12) , we know that

¦Á is 1.0, and the decomposition 
s 
¦Ã is the same as that in [12] , the proposed diffusion wavelet 
level 
basis is the same as that in [12] . In the noiseless case, Fig. 8 draws 
the recovery results of sensory data by BP, and each subgraph cor- 
responds to diffusion wavelet basis in Table 2 . In the second sub- 
gure of Fig. 8 , we make a comparison between the proposed dif- 
fusion wavelet basis and diffusion wavelet basis in [12] . By con- 
trast, the proposed diffusion wavelet basis can reduce relative er- 
ror by 0.0038¨C0.1033. In order to observe the changing trends of 
relative error, the number of measurements M ranges from 100 to 
700. For the noiseless and noise cases, Figs. 9 and 10 depict the 
comparison results of relative error in eight sparsifying bases. In 
¦Á is 0.1, and the value of 
¦Ã is 6. Seen from 
Fig. 9 , the value of 
Fig. 9 , the relative error decreases with the increase of M , and it 
reaches the minimum in diffusion wavelet basis of the paper. If 
the value of C is 1, the value of M min 
is 519. When the value of 
M isn¡¯t less than 500, relative error changes among 0.0281¨C0.0731. 
Otherwise, relative error ranges from 0.0572 to 0.7573. When the 
measurement noise is added to, relative error will change, but the 
comparative results remain the same. When the value of 
¦Ã is 2, we

sion wavelet basis [12] and the proposed diffusion wavelet basis 
are almost the same, as shown in Figs. 13 and 14 . For other values 
of M , Tables 4 and 5 give the numerical results of relative error 
corresponding to eight sparsifying bases in the noiseless and noise 
cases. When the measurement matrices are Gaussian random ma- 
trix and Bernoulli matrix, we carry out the recovery experiments 
of sensory data at the same condition, and show their recovery re- 
sults in Fig. 15 . Seen from four sub-gures, the curves of relative 
error have the same trends as those in Fig. 10 . The proposed diffu- 
sion wavelet basis can make the temperature data sparser, and the 
recovery performances are better than other sparsifying bases. 

4.4. Real data experiment 

The real data of temperature led come from National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration¡¯s National Weather Service [26] , 
temperature distribution in USA [27] , and Sea Surface Tempera- 
ture(100 KM Global) [28] . Fig. 16 (a) is the temperature led image 
of CONUS area provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad- 
ministration¡¯s National Weather Service [26] . Fig. 16 (b) is tempera- 
ture distribution in USA provided by NOAA [37] . Fig. 16 (c) and (d) 
are Sea Surface Temperature(100 KM Global) of two areas. There 
are 1024 sensor nodes deployed in the area and their locations are 
the same as those in Fig. 1 . Like synthetic data experiment, real 
data experiments are divided into the sparsity of sensory data and 
recovery of sensory data.

4.4.1. Sparsity of sensory data 
We use real temperature data to verify the proposed algorithm. 
¦Ã and the value 
The maximum value of the decomposition level 
of 
 are set as 8 and 10 
 respectively. Because the layout of all 
the nodes is the same as that in the synthetic data experiment, the 
constructed diffusion operator O in the step 11 and corresponding 
step24 are the same. However, the 
diffusion wavelet tree in step13 
¦Ã is 
value of numerical sparsity s at the same decomposition level 
different. 
Based on the experiments, we observe that real temperature 
data are approximately sparse in eight sparsifying bases. In the ex- 
periments, the value of 
¦Ã in [12] is set to be the same as that in 
the proposed algorithm for the best results. Table 6 separately lists 
the values of s and GI in each sub-gure of Fig. 16 . It can be seen 
that diffusion wavelet basis has an advantage over other six sparsi- 
fying bases. For sensory data in Fig. 16 (a) and (b), the proposed al- 
gorithm obtains the better diffusion wavelet basis when the value 
¦Á is 1.0. Because the value of 
¦Ã is set as the same, diffusion 
of 
wavelet basis [12] has the same values of s and GI as the proposed 
diffusion wavelet basis in Fig. 16 (a) and (b). For diffusion wavelet

the paper and that in [12] . 

obtain diffusion wavelet basis with the better performance. How- 
ever, both haar wavelet basis and bior3.1 wavelet basis also change. 
The above experiment is repeated and the results of relative error 
are shown in Fig. 10 . From Fig. 10 (a), we can see that relative error 
in the proposed diffusion wavelet basis is less than other seven 
sparsifying bases. When the value of M isn¡¯t less than 300, the 
range of relative error is 0.0260¨C0.1577 in the noiseless case. Oth- 
erwise, relative error changes from 0.14 4 4 to 0.3896. The results 
in Fig. 10 (b) are almost the same as those in the noiseless case. 
Moreover, we discover that relative error in the proposed diffusion 
wavelet basis is smaller than that in [12] , and the difference be- 
comes smaller with the increase of M . When the values of M are 
200 and 520, Figs. 11 ¨C14 show the visual effects of the recovered 
temperature data in the noiseless and noise cases, respectively. In 
Fig. 11 , relative error in spatial basis, DCT basis, DFT basis, haar 
wavelet basis, bior3.1 wavelet basis, dictionary obtained by K-SVD, 
diffusion wavelet basis [12] , and the proposed diffusion wavelet 
basis is 0.9963, 1.0534, 0.8933, 0.9967, 1.0749, 0.8848, 0.4470 and 
0.2539, respectively. From Fig. 11 , it can be seen that the recovery 
performance of the proposed diffusion wavelet basis is better than 
that in [12] . Fig. 12 takes the measurement noise into account. Rel- 
ative error corresponding to the eight sparsifying bases is 0.9943, 
1.0545, 0.8872, 0.9962, 1.0712, 0.8838, 0.4464 and 0.2503. With the 
increase of M , relative error is decreasing. When the value of M is 
520, the visual effects of the recovered temperature data in diffu- 

¦Á and 
¦Ã are 0.1 and 6 separately (a) without the measurement noise (b) with 
Fig. 9. The comparison results of relative error in eight sparsifying bases when the values of

basis [12] , the values of s are 12.3609 and 10.1734 in Fig. 16 (c) and 
(d), respectively. While the values of s in the proposed diffusion 
wavelet basis are 11.2932 and 9.3255, respectively. Compared with 
diffusion wavelet basis [12] , the proposed diffusion wavelet basis 
reduces the value of s in the two sub-gures, and makes real tem- 
perature data sparser. 
In the following analysis, we take real temperature data in 
¦Á , the numerical spar- 
Fig. 16 (a) for example. With the increase of 
sity s will change, and the changes are depicted in Fig. 17 . When 
¦Ã is 1, the numerical sparsity s of real 
the decomposition level 
temperature data is maximal, which signies that real temperature 
data are the least sparse. This phenomenon also appears in syn- 
thetic data experiment. The reason is that diffusion wavelet tree 
only includes orthogonal bases of scaling functions if the value of 
¦Ã is 1. While an integral diffusion wavelet tree should consist the 
orthogonal bases of scaling functions and the orthogonal bases of 
wavelets. Scaling functions are smoothly bumped functions with 
some oscillations(approximation), and wavelets are smoothly local- 
ized oscillatory(details) functions at the same scale. If only the or- 
thogonal bases of scaling function exist, details of real temperature 
data represented in diffusion wavelet basis are lost, which results 
in the increase of s . This is also the reason why the scope of J is 
 ¦Ã  1 in step 25. When the value of 
1 
¦Á is 1.0 and the value of 
¦Ã is 3, the proposed algorithm can obtain diffusion wavelet ba- 
sis with the better performance. If GI is the evaluation index, the 
values of 
¦Á and 
¦Ã corresponding to the maximum value of GI are 
0.1 and 2, respectively. Their diffusion wavelet coecients sorted 
in decreasing order by the magnitude are denoted in Fig. 18 , and

the proposed diffusion wavelet basis is better in terms of GI . How- 
ever, the numerical sparsity is more ecient in the proportion of 
effectively lar ge coecients than GI . As shown in Fig. 18 , the coe- 
cients with respect to the proposed diffusion wavelet basis contain 
the fewer large coecients, and real temperature data are sparser 
in the proposed diffusion wavelet basis. 
For sensory data in Fig. 16 (a), we compare the proposed diffu- 
sion wavelet basis with other seven sparsifying bases, and denote 
the comparative results of the coecients in Fig. 19 . The numer- 
ical comparisons are summarized in Table 6 , where the value of 
¦Á is 1.0 and the value of 
¦Ã is 3 in Fig. 16 (a). Seen from Table 6 , 
the numerical sparsity s of real temperature data in the spatial ba- 
sis is 10 0 0.7978, which is in close proximity to 1024, that is, real

temperature data are the least sparse in the spatial basis. Like the 
spatial basis, the numerical sparsity s of real temperature data in 
dictionary obtained by K-SVD is larger than other six sparsifying 
bases. In haar wavelet basis, the value of s is 209.1440. Bior3.1 
wavelet basis is almost the same as haar wavelet basis. Compared 
with DFT basis, real temperature data have more large coecients 
in DCT basis, which leads to the increase of s . The proposed dif- 
fusion wavelet basis can make the numerical sparsity s reach the 
minimum value 9.3906. So the performance of the proposed diffu- 

sion wavelet basis is better than the other seven sparsifying bases. 
For the best results, diffusion wavelet basis [12] has the same per- 
formance as the proposed diffusion wavelet basis. 

4.4.2. Recovery of sensory data 
In the recovery of sensory data, the measurement matrix and 
the sparsifying basis need to be considered. In real data experi- 
ments, the measurement matrix 
 is the same as that in the syn- 
 is the proposed 
thetic data experiment, and the sparsifying basis

diffusion wavelet basis. Besides, the other seven sparsifying bases 
mentioned above are used for comparison. 
Similarly, sensory data in Fig. 16 (a) are taken for example. From 
Table 6 , it can be seen that numerical sparsity s of real tempera- 
ture data in the proposed diffusion wavelet basis is 9.3906. Based 
on Eq. (12) and the lower bound of 
¦Ì( 
, 
 ), the minimum value

is determined by C 
logN . When the value of C is 1,

wavelet basis decreases the relative error by 0.0098¨C0.1301 than 
diffusion wavelet basis [12] with the maximum value of GI . In 
the second sub-gure, compared with the diffusion wavelet basis 
[12] with the maximum value of GI , the proposed diffusion wavelet 
basis reduces the relative error by 0.0086¨C0.1010. For sensory data 
in Fig. 16 , we conduct the recovery experiments in the noiseless 
and noise cases. Fig. 21 draws the relative error between the sen- 

sory data in Fig. 16 and the recovered sensory data in the noiseless 
case, and gives the comparison results between the eight sparsi- 
fying bases. Fig. 21 includes four sub-gures, and each sub-gure

perature data in each sub-gure. We have analyzed the recovery

of 
¦Ã are 5 in Fig. 16 (c), and 
this moment, the corresponding values of 
6 in Fig. 16 (d). The numerical results of relative error are listed in 
Table 8 . 
With the increase of M , it can be seen from Fig. 21 that relative 
error decreases gradually. Because the number of sensor nodes N 
is 1024, the numerical sparsity s of real temperature data is a con- 
stant in the given sparsifying basis. If the value of M is larger, com- 

pressive data gathering can acquire the more information about 
original sensory data. In this case, relative error is smaller and the 
recovery of data is more accurate. However, if the value of M is 
smaller, it isn¡¯t enough for accurate recovery, and relative error be- 
comes larger. In four sub-gures, the spatial basis and DFT basis 
have an advantage over four sparsifying bases(i.e. DCT basis, haar 
wavelet basis, bior3.1 wavelet basis and dictionary obtained by K- 
SVD). However, relative error in diffusion wavelet basis [12] and

same as the proposed diffusion wavelet basis for the best results. 
In Fig. 23 (a) and (b), the proposed algorithm gets diffusion wavelet 
basis with the better performance when the value of 
¦Á is 1.0. So 
the two diffusion wavelet bases have the same relative error in 
two sub-gures. Seen from Fig. 23 (c) and (d), the proposed dif- 
fusion wavelet basis reduces relative error compared with other 
seven sparsifying bases. When the value of M ranges from 100 to 
300 by the step size 50, relative error of the recovery of sensory 
data in Fig. 23 (c) is 0.1594, 0.1017, 0.0922, 0.0738 and 0.0644 in 
the proposed diffusion wavelet basis. For sensory data in Fig. 23 (d), 
relative error of data recovery is 0.1468, 0.1246, 0.1044, 0.0913 and 
0.0765 when the proposed diffusion wavelet basis is chosen as the 
sparsifying basis. Through the experiments and analysis, we know 
that the proposed diffusion wavelet basis has the advantage over 
other seven sparsifying bases in the noiseless and noise cases. 

5. Conclusions 

The paper studies the effect of the communication radius and 
the wavelet decomposition level on the construction of diffusion 
operator, and proposes a diffusion wavelet basis algorithm to make 
sensory data on the graph represented in a sparser way. Based on 
the locations of sensor nodes and the communication radius, we 
analyze the performance of high powers of diffusion operator and 
conduct the experiments. Theoretical and experimental investiga- 
tions prove that high powers of the constructed diffusion opera- 
tor have low numerical rank. Based on measure of sparsity, the 
algorithm chooses the diffusion wavelet basis with better perfor- 
mance. From the results of synthetic data experiment and real data 
experiment, we see that sensory data are approximately sparse in 
different sparsifying bases. Compared with seven sparsifying bases 
such as the spatial basis, DCT basis, DFT basis, haar wavelet basis, 
bior3.1 wavelet basis, dictionary obtained by K-SVD and diffusion 
wavelet basis [12] , sensory data are the sparsest in the proposed 
diffusion wavelet. Furthermore, we consider the effect of the noise 
on data recovery, and study the recovery of sensory data in the 
noise cases. Through the experiments, we discover that the pro- 
posed diffusion wavelet basis is superior to other seven sparsifying 
bases in terms of data recovery when the difference between diffu- 
sion wavelet basis [12] and the proposed diffusion wavelet basis is 
larger. If the difference is smaller, diffusion wavelet basis [12] have

11.2932 and 9.3255. When the value of M ranges from 100 to 300, 
we observe from Fig. 21 (c) and (d) that relative error of the pro- 
posed diffusion wavelet is less than that of diffusion wavelet ba- 
sis [12] . When the value of M becomes larger, their results are 
almost the same. As a result, diffusion wavelet basis constructed 
by the proposed algorithm can make sensory data sparser, and re- 
duces the relative error when the value of M is smaller. Further- 
more, when the measurement matrices are Gaussian random ma- 
trix and Bernoulli matrix, we also study the recovery performance 
of the proposed diffusion wavelet basis in the noiseless and noise 
cases, and show the relative error of data recovery in Fig. 22 . In 
the same way, we can also draw the conclusion that the recovery 
performance of the proposed diffusion wavelet is better than other 
sparsifying bases. 
When the measurement noise is considered and the measure- 
ment matrix is sparse binary matrix with a xed number of 
nonzero entries in each column, Fig. 23 shows the comparison re- 
sults of relative error in eight sparsifying bases, and Table 9 gives 
the numerical results of relative error. Compared with Fig. 21 , the 
recovery performances in haar wavelet basis and bior3.1 wavelet

the same recovery performance as the proposed diffusion wavelet 
basis in the best case. 
The paper only studies the construction of diffusion wavelet 
based sparsifying basis, and doesn¡¯t further research the design of 
the measurement matrix. For WSNs, the energy consumption and 
data gathering delay are also the important evaluation index. In 
the future study, the design of sparsifying basis and the measure- 
ment matrix are combined to improve the data gathering perfor- 
mance, which makes the work to be more meaningful.
