abstract 

In this work, an image encryption method is proposed based on fuzzy cellular neural network (FCNN). 
First, the shortcomings of FCNN in encrypting image are identied, and the FCNN model is then modied 
to address these shortcomings. Specically, a theoretical framework is developed to identify the values of 
the parameters of FCNN to generate chaotic signals, which are in turn utilized to encrypt the image. The 
encryption method is designed where an encrypted pixel is generated based on the corresponding plain- 
text pixel together with the neighbouring encrypted pixels. The proposed method has a key sensitivity in 
10 to achieve adequate security robustness. Further evaluations on standard test images 
the order of 10 
veried and conrmed that the proposed encryption method is robust against plaintext-only (i.e., brutal 
force) and chosen-plaintext attacks.

1. Introduction 
Image encryption is a process that transforms an image into an 
unintelligible form to mask its perceptual semantic [1,2] . With the 
advent of affordable capturing devices, ubiquitous network connec- 
tion and free social networking service, images are generated and 
shared online at a staggering rate of 300 million pictures per day 
on Facebook itself [3] . Free cloud storage services further encour- 
age users to store personal images online for easy of access. How- 
ever, even ordinary users start to concern about their privacies as 
well as safeties nowadays. Therefore, encryption emerges as an im- 
portant layer of protection for both privacy and safety in the age 
of cloud computing. 
Although the conventional encryption methods such as IDEA, 
AES, RSA and DES can be deployed directly to encrypt image (e.g., 
treating image as a sequence of values), these methods are insu- 
cient for encryption as detailed in Ref. [4] . 
Chaos appears as an attractive alternative for encryption be- 
cause of its complex dynamic behaviors, which shows apparently 
random occurrences within a determined nonlinear system or pro- 
cess. Also, chaos has the characteristics of categories of noise- 
sensitive initial long-term unpredictability, ergodicity, and the di- 
vergence index, which are the desired properties in the application 
of encryption. Therefore, many digital image encryption methods 
have been proposed based on chaotic systems [5每10] . For exam- 
ple, Zhou et al., have invented a novel image encryption algorithm 
based on chaos and line map [5] , while Assad and Farajallah pro- 
posed a new chaos-based image encryption system [8] . The prob- 
lem of cracking a hierarchical chaotic image encryption algorithm 
based on permutation has been derived by Li, [10] . 
In addition, neural networks possess attractive properties such 
as high nonlinearity, parameter sensitivity and learning ability, 
hence they are widely utilized as an alternative choice for infor- 
mation protection, such as data encryption, data authentication 
and intrusion detection [11] . As a results, various chaotic neural 
based encryption algorithms are proposed [12每15] . For example, 
Wen et al. investigated into the problem of global exponential lag 
synchronization of a class of switched neural networks with time- 
varying delays via the neural activation controller and its applica- 
tions in image encryption [12] . Chua and Yang [16,17] then pro- 
posed a new model-traditional cellular neural networks (CNNs). 
Subsequently, CNNs have attracted much attention because of their 
established background in theory and practical applications, in- 
cluding image processing. 
Based on traditional CNN, Yang et al. proposed the fuzzy cel- 
lular neural networks (FCNNs) [18,19] , which integrates fuzzy logic 
into the structure of traditional CNN and maintains local connect- 
edness among cells. FCNNs is a generalization of CNNs with high 
level information processing capability, such as image understand- 
ing of fuzzy systems. Therefore, it is of great importance to analyze 
the dynamical behaviors of FCNNs both in theory and applications. 
Recently, Abdurahman et al. [20] investigated into the theoretical 
results of nite-time synchronization for FCNNs with time-varying 
delays. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no results 
reported for FCNNs in the eld of encryption. 
To ll the research gap, in this paper we reformulate the 
FCNN system for encryption purpose by making it more secure 
against chosen-plaintext attack. Specically, to generate an en- 
crypted pixel, both the pixel being processed and those that are 
already encrypted are considered. This paper makes the following 
contributions: (a) The key space is large enough to make brute- 
force attacks infeasible; (b) a quantitative analysis with compara- 
tive result is provided, and (c) Experimental results are shown to 
prove the effectiveness of our method. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2 presents the background study of chaotic FCNN. 
Section 3 reformulates the chaotic FCNN for image encryption 
purpose. Experiments results are presented in Section 4 . Analysis 
including key sensitivity and statistics are discussed in Section 5 . 
Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper. 

2. Background study 

Similar to neural networks, CNNs are a parallel computing 
paradigm with the difference that communication is allowed only 
between neighboring units [16,17] . Its application include image 
processing, associative memories, classication of patterns, analyz- 
ing 3D surfaces, quadratic optimization, solving partial differen- 
tial equations, reducing non-visual problems to geometric maps, 
modeling biological vision and other sensory-motor organs, and so 
forth. 
There are various uncertainties in every stage of image pro- 
cessing, for example, loss of information when 3D objects are 
projected into 2D plane, additive and non-additive noise in the 
transmission processes, lack of quantitative measurement of im- 
age quality, imprecision in computations, etc. Fuzzy set theory 
provides the mathematical tools to capture these uncertainties. 
Therefore, it is reasonable to integrate fuzzy set theory into the 
CNN paradigm to give birth to a new image-processing paradigm 
termed FCNN, which takes uncertainties into consideration. Each 
cell in an FCNN contains fuzzy operating abilities, yet the entire 
network is governed by the cellular computing laws as proposed 
by Yang et al. [18,19] . FCNN has been proven to be a very useful 
paradigm for image processing and pattern recognition. 
Consider the following chaotic FCNN:

FCNN (1) generates chaotic signals, which can be applied to 
the pixels of an image to generate unintelligible encrypted image. 
However, in its unmodied form, FCNN falls short in two aspects: 
(i) key-sensitivity, where any slight change in the parameters (i.e., 
secret keys) of FCNN, there is no signicant change in any of the 
RGB channels of the encrypted color image, and; (ii) plaintext sen- 
sitivity, where any slight change in color plain image will lead to 
slight (i.e., insignicant) change in the corresponding color pixel in 
the encrypted image. As a result, in its present form, FCNN based 
encryption is vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attack. In this work, 
we begin by showing how FCNN can be used in encrypting an 
image and further changes are needed to be made in the FCNN 
expressed in (1) to address the aforementioned issues, i.e., with- 
standing well-accepted cryptographical attacks. 

3. System formulation 

In this formulation, the variable t in the chaotic signal 步 x i 
(t )
℅ N repre- 
takes the values in the range of [1, MN ], where M 
sents the dimension of the image. Further, to ease the presen- 
tation, the image I ( x, y ) is linearized to a vector IMG ( K ), where 
℅ N for the image of dimension M 
℅ N . To cater 
K 
for color image, IMG i 
( K ) refers to the i th color channel of the 
K th pixel, where i 
 { R, G, B } in which R, G and B represent the 
red, green, and blue color channels, respectively. The goal is to 
use each generated FCNN chaotic signal expressed in (1) together 
with each pixel of the original image to generate the output en- 
crypted pixel. Hence, the length of the variables t and K is the 
(t )
same. To add another layer of security, the chaotic signal 步 x i 
 can 
begin at any point in the originally generated chaotic signal, i.e., 
≡ 0. The new chaotic signal that can be 
t 
 MN] for t 0 
used for image encryption, which is denoted by y i 
( K ) and can be 
computed as

each new chaotic signal 步 y i 
 is multiplied with each original pixel 
IMG ( K ). This can be achieved by

where E ( IMG ( K )) is the encrypted pixel of IMG ( K ). 
However, when any parameter in (1) , i.e., a ij 
, 
, and 
, 
is slightly changed, then it only affects the channel where its pa- 
rameter was changed. Hence, the encryption method has low key- 
sensitivity. To overcome the abovementioned drawback, we intro- 
duce further substantial changes in (4) in a way that withstands 
the well-accepted cryptographical attacks. 
First, we introduce the key E key 
that depends on all three color 
channels as follows:

27.56 s to encrypt a color image of dimension 512 
cludes the time needed to generate the chaotic signal. Similarly, on 
average, it takes approximately 27.24 s to decrypt an encrypted im- 
age of the same size. The average encryption and decryption time 
needed for each image in the Uncompressed Color Image Database 
(UCID) dataset [21] are 13.57 and 13.50 s, respectively, where each

result for 1338 images. In the following subsections, perceptual se- 
mantic masking, information entropy, key space size, key sensitiv- 
ity test, and statistical attacks are presented, which are all crucial 
in any image encryption system.

4.1. Masking perceptual semantic 

To examine the proposed reformulated FCNN system (3) for 
successful encryption and decryption, six standard test color im- 
ages from the USC-SIPI image database [22] , namely Baboon, F-16, 
℅ 512 
℅ 3, 
House, Lake, Lenna and Tiffany, each of dimension 512 
are considered. The test images are shown in Fig. 2 . The trajectory 
of the reformulated FCNN for Lenna is shown in Fig. 3 , which will 
be utilized to encrypt the test image - Lenna. For completion of 
discussion, we also conducted the experiments by using the UCID 
℅ 512. 
dataset [21] , which consists of 1338 images each of dimension 384 
Fig. 4 illustrate the encrypted images. It is observed that the 
proposed FCNN based encryption system successfully masked the 
perceptual semantic of the original image, because the encrypted 
images appear to be noise. 
Next, for each encrypted test image, the entropy of each color 
channel (i.e., utilized as an image) is considered. Specically, in- 
formation entropy gives an indication of randomness and it is de- 
ned to express the degree of uncertainties in a system. Let m be 
the information source, and information entropy H computed is as 
follows [6] :

where N represents the total number of gray levels, and p ( m i

is the probability of occurrence of the symbol m i 
. The maximum 
value of H is 8, where all gray levels are equally probable, i.e., uni- 
form distribution. The entropy of the encrypted images obtained

by the proposed method and Hsiao et al.＊s method [6] are shown 
in Table 1 . Since only the results of two test images, namely Ba- 
boon and Lenna, are reported in Bigdeli et al.＊s work [13] , their re- 
sults are omitted from Table 1 . Nonetheless, they achieved the en- 
tropy of (7.9967, 7.9941, 7.9985) for the RGB channels respectively 
for Baboon, and similarly (7.9981, 7.9962, 7.9974) for Lenna. It is 
evidently shown that the entropy value of our proposed method 
is comparable to those of the conventional methods considered. 
In addition, the entropy values are high, i.e., near 8 which is the 
bit-depth of each channel, hence the distributions are close to uni- 
form. It is also noteworthy that both Hsiao et al.＊s method [6] and 
the proposed method are able to increase the entropy of the origi- 

>

nal test image, which is supported by the result attained by Tiffany 
- red channel. Specically, the entropy value was increased from 
4.33 to as high as 
 7.99 in both methods, which is an increment 
of about 80%. When considering the UCID dataset [21] , the average 
entropy values achieved are (7.9977, 7.9977, 7.9977) for the RGB 
channels, respectively, which are near to the maximum value of 
8 as expected. Therefore, the proposed method is able to produce 
encrypted image with high entropy, which is desired in any image 
encryption algorithm. 
The corresponding decrypted images are shown in Fig. 5 . The 
mean square error (MSE) between the original and decrypted im- 
ages (using the correct keys) are recorded in Table 2 for each of the

by using Matlab＊s function - rgb2gray . As expected, the PSNR and 
SSIM values are high, which agree with Fig. 5 and the MSE values. 
Similar results are obtained for the UCID dataset [21] , and we omit 
the discussion here. 

4.2. Secret key space 

The brute-force attack commences by considering an one-digit 
secret key, and then proceed to two-digit secret key, and so on 
until the maximum length is reached. In order to resist against 
the brute-force attack, the secret key space should be convincingly 
large [4] . In this work, the secret key of the proposed algorithm is 
℅ 3 parameters that can be expressed as 
a combination of three 3 

color channels. Note that the MSE is greater than zero because the 
proposed encryption system involves the manipulation of large in- 
tegers, which are needed to make the proposed encryption system 
robust against various attacks. Nonetheless, the decrypted images 
appear to be perceptually identical to their original counterparts 
as shown in Fig. 5 . For completion of discussion, the correspond- 
ing PSNR and SSIM values for all test images are also recorded in 
the last two columns of Table 2 . Here, the PSNR and SSIM values 
are computed by the using grayscale images, which are generated

tion method is sucient to ensure that brute-force attack is in- 
feasible. Note that the key space can be further increased accord- 
ingly by increasing the precision. A comparison of secret key space

for the proposed and other conventional encryption methods are 
summarized in Table 3 . It is apparent that the proposed encryp- 
tion method has the largest key space. 

4.3. Key sensitivity test 

To illustrate the key sensitivity of the proposed encryption 
method, the image encrypted by using the parameter settings in 
12) is decrypted using the same parameters, but with a slight 
(8 
10 as summarized in Table 4 . In other 
mismatch in the order of 10 
words, the exactly same key is used for decryption, except for the 
changes summarized in Table 4 . Using Lenna as the representa- 
tive test image, the corresponding decrypted images are shown in 
Fig. 6 . Results suggest that a slight change in any of parameters 
10 leads to a completely different image (i.e., 
in the order of 10 
noise), which do not infer any information about the original im- 
age. Therefore, the proposed encryption method is veried to be 
sensitive to the key in use. 

To verify the robustness of the proposed encryption method, a 
statistical analysis is performed for the plaintext and the encrypted 
images in the following two aspects. 

4.4.1. Histogram analysis 
A histogram reects the distribution of the pixel values for a 
given image. Any effective image encryption method should mask 
the perceptual meaning of the plaintext image and atten its his- 
togram (i.e., become near uniform distribution). The histogram be- 
fore and after encryption are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 for the test 
images Lenna and Baboon, respectively. It is apparent that the his- 
tograms of the encrypted image are fairly uniform and hence sig- 
nicantly different from that of the original images. The outcome 
for other images are similar and we omit the results here. All in 
all, the histogram does not provide any useful clue for an attacker 
to launch any statistical attacks on the proposed image encryption 
procedure. Therefore, the proposed encryption method successfully 
randomized the pixels. 

4.4.2. Correlation analysis 
In the plain image, the correlation coecients are high in gen- 
eral, because the adjacent pixels in all three directions, i.e., the hor- 
izontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, often have the same or a 
similar pixel values. However, in the encrypted image, the corre- 
lation coecients should be low (e.g., close to zero), i.e., uncor- 
related. To illustrate the pixel correlations before and after encryp- 
tion, 20 0 0 pixels are randomly selected as the x value. Correspond- 
ingly, one of the 8 neighbors of each selected pixel is chosen to 
be its y value. As the representative examples, the graph of these 
points P ( x, y ) are plotted in Figs. 9 and 10 for the test images Lenna 
and Baboon, respectively. As expected, the highly correlated pixels 
(i.e., before encryption) show little to no correlation after encryp- 
tion. 
For further analysis, the correlation coecients of the plain im- 
age and the encrypted image are computed as follows:

and y i 
denote pixel values of two different pixels in 
the image itself or between two different images. Here, cov ( x, 
y ) indicates the covariance, D ( x ) and D ( y ) are the variance, and 
E ( x ) and E ( y ) are the means. 

The results are recorded in Table 5 , which suggest that the pro- 
posed encryption method can effectively randomize the pixel val- 

ues because the correlation coecients is small in magnitude for 
all color channels. The encrypted pixel values show little to no cor- 
relation, which also agree with the graphs in Figs. 9 and 10 for the 
case of Lenna and Baboon, respectively. The rest of the images (in- 
cluding those from the UCID dataset [21] ) behave similarly and we 
omit the results here. 
The proposed method is also compared with the conventional 
encryption methods in terms of correlation coecients, and the 
results are recorded in Table 6 . Results suggest that, for all encryp- 
tion methods considered, the neighboring pixels in the encrypted

4.5. Chosen-plaintext attack 

One of the signicant sensitivity analysis is plaintext sensitiv- 
ity, which is also known as chosen-plaintext attack. Plaintext sen- 
sitive means that any tiny disturbance of the plain-image will lead 
to dramatic changes in the encrypted image. Therefore, in order 
to measure the difference between the resulting encrypted im- 
ages, there are two criteria, namely, number of pixels change rate 
(NPCR), which is dened as:

attack. For example, the average NPCR is 99.95% even when the in- 
put images differ only by 1 pixel. 
For completion of discussion, the NPCR and UACI scores at- 
tained by the proposed encryption method are also compared with 
those of the conventional methods. It is observed that all consid- 
ered methods exhibit high NPCR and low UACI, suggesting their 
high plaintext sensitivity property. Nonetheless, it is observed that 
the proposed method outperforms the conventional encryption 
methods considered in both NPCR and UACI ( Table 8 ). 

5. Conclusions 

In this work, we reformulated the FCNN to encrypt color im- 
age. Specically, we use each generated FCNNs chaotic signal ex- 
pressed in (1) together with each pixel of the original image to 
generate the output encrypted pixel, which makes the proposed 
encryption system robust against various cryptanalysis, including 
plaintext-only and chosen-plaintext attacks. To add another layer 
of security, the chaotic signal can begin at any point in the orig- 
inally generated chaotic signal. The key sensitivity was veried to 
10 . In addition, plaintext sensitivity tests and 
be in the order of 10 
statistical analysis against the conventional methods demonstrated 
the effectiveness of our proposed method. 
As future work, fast computation method for the proposed 
FCNN will be designed to meet the requirements of real-time ap- 
plications. In addition, the proposed FCNN will be further rened 
for applications in other domains, including audio and video where 
the samples are highly correlated.
