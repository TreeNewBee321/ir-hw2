abstract

Growing desalination capacity worldwide has made management of discharge brines an increasingly urgent
environmental challenge. An important step in understanding how to choose between different brine man-
agement processes is to study the energetics of these processes. In this paper, we analyze two different
ways of managing highly saline brines. The rst method is complete separation with production of salts
(i.e., zero-discharge desalination or ZDD). Thermodynamic limits of the ZDD process were calculated. This
result was applied to the state-of-the-art industrial ZDD process to quantify how close these systems are
to the thermodynamic limit, and to compare the energy consumption of the brine concentration step to
the crystallization step. We conclude that the brine concentration step has more potential for improvement
compared to the crystallization step. The second brine management method considered is salinity-gradient
power generation through pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO), which utilizes the brine＊s high concentration
to produce useful work while reducing its concentration by mixing the brine with a lower salinity stream
in a controlled manner. We model the PRO system coupled with a desalination system using a detailed
numerical optimization, which resulted in about 0.42 kW h/m3 of energy saving.

1. Introduction

Desalination produces a concentrated brine which has to be dis-
charged back to the environment. Brine management has become a
challenging task due to large increases in desalination capacity. In
2015, global desalination capacity reached 87 Mm3 /day, of which 51
Mm3 /day is seawater desalination. Figure 1 shows the growth of the
global desalination capacity over recent years [1每6].
Seawater desalination has a recovery of roughly 50% [7], produc-
ing nearly equal ows of brine and product. Recovery varies greatly
for the desalination of different feed waters, which makes it hard
to estimate the volume of brine discharge knowing only the treated
water production rate. As a conservative estimate, over 50 Mm3
of brine is discharged everyday. This large and growing quantity
of brine should be managed with care in order to avoid harmful
environmental effects.
One method of mitigating the environmental concerns from
brine discharge is by avoiding discharge all together through the
usage of zero-discharge desalination (ZDD) designs, which should
be differentiated from zero-liquid discharge (ZLD) because ZDD does
not even discharge salt. Near-ZDD designs have been implemented
commercially for producing salt from seawater [8,9]. Economi-
cally feasible ZDD system designs for seawater desalination have
also been proposed [10]. ZDD and ZLD systems broadly use two
steps/sub-systems: a brine concentration step that concentrates the
feed stream to near saturation conditions, and a crystallization step

where saturated brine is completely crystallized. Several technology
options exist for the brine concentration and crystallization steps.
For the brine concentration step, the technologies that have been
deployed industrially include: electrodialysis (ED) [8,9], mechanical
vapor compression systems (MVC) [11每13], and solar evaporation
ponds [11,14]. In Japan, electrodialysis (ED) has been used exten-
sively for concentrating brine for salt production [8]. In such systems,
incoming seawater feed is split into diluate and concentrate streams.
The feed in the concentrate stream is typically concentrated from
35 g/kg to 200 g/kg while the diluate is diluted to slightly less than
35 g/kg and discharged back into the sea. ED systems are appropri-
ate when partial desalination is an option [15]. For complete brine
concentration producing pure product water, MVC systems are pri-
marily used. The crystallization step in ZDD and ZLD is typically
achieved through multi-effect evaporators [11] or solar evaporation
ponds [11,14]. Apart from the above processes, newer processes such
as SAL-PROC also exist where brine is sequentially crystallized using
both evaporation and chemical processing [16]. More recently, mem-
brane distillation (MD) has emerged as an alternative technology for
an integrated brine concentration and crystallization process due to
its ability to handle highly concentrated feed water [17每21].
Another method of handling brine discharge is to utilize the
brine＊s exergy to produce power while lowering its salinity. This
is done by using salinity-gradient power production technologies.
Among these technologies, pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) is
believed to be the most promising technology because of its higher
energy density [22,23] although efforts to improve technologies
such as reverse electrodialysis (RED) are continuing [24,25]. In
PRO, two ow streams at different salinities are introduced into a
module where a semi-permeable membrane selectively rejects salt
molecules. The more concentrated stream is commonly referred to
as the draw stream and the less concentrated one as feed. Because
of the chemical potential difference, osmosis occurs and water is
drawn from the feed to the draw side. The draw stream is pressur-
ized before being sent into the module which retards the osmosis
(hence the name pressure-retarded osmosis). The applied pressure
difference is smaller than the osmotic pressure difference so that
osmosis is allowed to occur. The draw stream leaving the module is
run through a turbine to produce power. The power produced by the
system is net positive because the ow rate of the draw is higher at
the outlet due to osmosis.

Some researchers have studied coupling PRO to a desalination
system [26,27], but their analyses were limited to the salinity range
of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) (brine salinity of about 70 g/kg).
Prante et al. [28] considered a wide range of salinities, but their PRO
model was set up in parallel ow conguration, which is always less
ecient than the counterow conguration [29], and the analysis
used an average ux, which results in an inaccurate representation
of the variations actually found in a module每scale system.

1.1. Objective

In this paper, we study the thermodynamic limits of the two types
of processes outlined above, and their corresponding subsystems in
order to understand how far current systems are from these lim-
its and to guide attempts to improve these systems. While energy
considerations alone are not sucient to guide the choice between
different systems, understanding the energetics of the different brine
management processes is essential in understanding their operation.
Although the two brine management technologies produce different
outputs, the underlying physics are so similar that they warrant tan-
dem treatment. One process involves separation of salt and water
whereas the other mixes salt and water in a controlled manner, and
both can be analyzed with the same thermodynamic principles.
We rst approach ZDD brine management method from a purely
thermodynamic perspective. While several researchers have pro-
posed ZDD-like systems for producing both water and salt from
seawater and while several commercial plants have been built, a
study outlining the thermodynamic limits on the work required for
producing salt and water from seawater in a ZDD process is miss-
ing in the literature. ZDD is typically achieved using a series of
sub-processes and technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO), ED,
mechanical vapor compression (MVC) systems, multi-effect evapo-
rators and crystallizers. An understanding of the performance limits
of ZDD informs process designers and researchers on where current
ZDD processes and sub-processes stand in terms of eciency as well
as the potential for improvement. To address these issues, a detailed
analysis of the thermodynamic minimum work required for con-
centrating brine up to the saturation limit and the minimum work
for subsequent crystallization for salt production are presented. In
addition, we calculate the Second Law eciency values of the state-
of-the-art technologies used in industrial ZDD process to compare
relative magnitude of energy input required for brine concentration
and crystallization step.
For the salinity-gradient power generation method, we have
performed an analysis from fundamental thermodynamic laws to
understand the energetics of the coupling process. Based on this
fundamental understanding, we expand our study to a practical
power generation system using pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO)
and quantify the energetic saving of adding PRO. We use nonlin-
ear optimization to determine the best operating conditions, which
results in general results (i.e., not restricted to a particular choice of
operating conditions).

2. Blackbox systems

2.1. Salt production and zero-discharge desalination

In this section we present an analysis of the thermodynamic
minimum work required for brine concentration as well as salt pro-
duction. Figure 2 shows a blackbox diagram of a brine concentrator
at a salinity sf and mass ow rate 步mf . The brine concentrator pro-
as well as a crystallizer. Feed enters the black box brine concentrator

and 步ms . In our analysis, the blackbox brine concentrator and blackbox
crystallizer are work driven systems. Under reversible conditions,
the work required would be the ＆least work＊ thermodynamically pos-
sible, which for brine concentration and crystallization we designate
and 步W least
crys , respectively. Thus, the least work for brine con-
centration is the least work for concentrating from a given feed
salinity up to saturation, while the least work for crystallization is the
least work for taking a saturated solution up to complete separation
of water and salt [30].
To calculate the least work, the First and Second Laws of ther-
modynamics were applied to each blackbox. The resulting equations
were then combined to express the least work required by each
black box as a function of the specic Gibbs energy of the incoming
and outgoing streams. For a reversible process, the entropy gener-
ation is zero. Thus, we get the thermodynamic least work required
for brine concentration and crystallization given by Eqs. (1) and (2)
under the assumption that the inlet and outlet streams have the
same temperature and pressure.

where g is the specic Gibbs energy. The detailed derivation of Eq.
(1) can be found in Mistry et al. [31]. Equation (2) was obtained by
following the same methodology outlined by Mistry et al. [31]. Both
Eqs. (1) and (2) have been derived previously on a per mole basis by
Van der Haam [32].
As can be seen, the nal expressions for least work in Eqs. (1)
and (2) are functions of the mass ow rates and the specic Gibbs
energies (on a per mass basis) of streams entering and leaving the
blackbox. The specic Gibbs energy of the feed, product and brine
solution streams (on a per mass basis) are calculated using the activ-
ity coecients of the sodium chloride and pure water components
(on a per mole basis). The activity coecients were obtained from an
implementation by Thiel et al. [30,33] of Pitzer＊s equations modeling
the thermodynamics of aqueous electrolyte solutions [34每39]. Thiel
et al. [30] found that aqueous NaCl serves as a reasonable surrogate
for the property estimation in certain high salinity waters.
In Chapter 2 of his thesis, Van der Haam [32] had described the
derivation of the least work of crystallization. Here, the methodology
is presented in a simplied manner. Additionally, to the best of our
knowledge, the detailed results described here related to the least
work of crystallization, have not been published. For these reasons,
we have described below how the least work of crystallization was
evaluated along with a detailed analysis and discussion of results for
the least work for brine concentration and crystallization for varying
feed inlet salinities.
Equation (2) can be expressed on a molar basis as:

where g is the partial molar Gibbs energy of each stream and 步N refers
to molar ow rate of each stream. The three streams are identied by
the subscripts: ＆p, crys＊ for the product water leaving the crystallizer,
＆b＊ for the brine stream entering the crystallizer and ＆s＊ for the salt
stream leaving the crystallizer. The expression for least work of crys-
tallization can be further expressed as a function of the molar ow
rates of sodium chloride and water in the brine stream as:

步W least
crys = 步NH2O,b ( gH2O,p,crys  gH2O,b ) + 步NNaCl,b ( gNaCl,s  gNaCl,b )

(4)
where 步NH2O,b and 步NNaCl,b are given by, 步NH2O,b = 步mp /(MH2O ) and
步NNaCl,b = 步ms /(MNaCl ). The molar masses of pure water (MH2O ) and
tively. gH2O,p,crys and gH2O,b are the partial molar Gibbs energies of
sodium chloride (MNaCl ) are 18.02 g/mol and 58.44 g/mol respec-
pure water in the product and brine streams while gNaCl,s and gNaCl,b
are the partial molar Gibbs energies of sodium chloride in the solid
salt and aqueous brine streams.
From thermodynamic principles, at saturation, sodium chloride in
the solid hydrous form is in equilibrium with the sodium chloride in
the saturated solution. Thus, the partial molar Gibbs energies of solid
sodium chloride and of sodium chloride in its saturated solution are
equal:

gNaCl,s = gNaCl,sat

(5)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Now, Eq. (4), can be expressed as function of the activities of sodium
chloride and water in the three streams as:

步W least
crys = RT

步NH2O,b ln

aH2O,p,crys
aH2O,b

+ 步NNaCl,b ln

(cid:3)

where, R is the universal gas constant given by 8.3145 J/mol K, T is
the temperature in kelvin, which in this case is 298 K, and a refers to
the activities of the components in a stream. For the crystallizer, the
incoming brine is assumed to be saturated, thus the equation further
simplies as:

aH2O,p,crys
aH2O,sat

步W least
crys = RT

步NH2O,sat ln

(7)
Expressing 步NH2O,sat as a function of the feed mass ow rate ( 步mf ) and
feed salinity (sf ) into the brine concentrator, we get:

Similarly, the above analysis can be applied to the combined con-
trol volumes of both the black box brine concentrator and black

expression is similar to that given by Eq. (6):

where, aH2O,p represents the activity of water in the pure product
water, the value of which is the same in the product water streams
from both the brine concentrator and crystallizer. The activities in
the above equations were obtained as previously mentioned from an
implementation of Pitzer＊s equations by Thiel et al. [30,33].

ow rate of the feed into the brine concentrator ( 步mf ). Alternatively,
the least work could be normalized by either the mass of the salt
produced or by that of the water produced, depending typically on
what is the desired substance. For the purpose of brine management,
normalizing using the feed mass ow rates is appropriate because
one of the main aims of brine management is to reduce the mass of
an incoming feed stream. The total least work required in general
increases with the feed salinity, but as the feed becomes saturated,
the total least work required decreases marginally. This trend results
from competing effects in the least work of completely crystallizing
saturated brine and the least work for concentrating brine to satura-
tion. As feed salinity increases, the salt content for a xed total feed
mass increases proportionately, resulting in a corresponding linear
increase in the least work for crystallization. The linear relationship
of least work of crystallization with feed salinity can be inferred
as well from Eq. (8). For brine concentration, as the feed salinity
increases, two effects compete: the energy required to remove an
incremental amount of water increases while the absolute amount of
water needed to be removed to achieve saturation decreases. The for-
mer effect dominates initially up to feed salinities around 120 g/kg,
while for higher salinities the latter effect dominates.
For comparison, the ratio of the least work for concentrating feed
until saturation to the total least work for complete separation is
shown in Fig. 4. At a feed salinity of 100 g/kg, brine concentration
contributes 50% of the total least work. This can also be seen in Fig. 3,
where at a feed salinity of 100 g/kg, the least work for brine concen-
tration and least work for crystallization cross over. It is evident from
both of these gures that the least work for brine concentration until
saturation and the least work for complete crystallization thereafter
are comparable in the desalination range of feed salinities (35 g/kg to
120 g/kg), after which the least work of crystallization is dominant.
To put the least work values in perspective, we calculated them
at a specic feed salinity. For a feed salinity of 35 g/kg, the least work
for brine concentration until saturation is 6.94 kJ/kg-feed while the
least work for complete crystallization is 3.81 kJ/kg-feed. Thus, brine
concentration contributes to 64.5% of the total least work. Figure 5
shows the percentage of water mass remaining as 35 g/kg feed is
concentrated until saturation. At saturation, approximately 90% of
the original water mass has been removed through brine concentra-
tion. Crystallization separates the remaining 10% of original water
mass. The last step of removing 10% of the original water mass
requires 35.5% of the total least work. Thus, under ideal operating

conditions, crystallization is a more work intensive step than brine
concentration when viewed from a perspective of volume or mass
reduction. However, crystallization is typically a thermally driven
process. Because least work of crystallization represented here is the
exergetic values, thermal energy input for crystallization has to be
converted to its exergy so that it can be clearly compared with the
performance limits of brine concentration.
For the benet of readers in the desalination industry, the results
for least work from Fig. 3 relevant to the salinity range for seawa-
ter desalination operation (35 g/kg to 120 g/kg feed salinities) were
represented separately in Fig. 6. The gure further highlights that for
typical operating conditions, the least work for brine concentration
until saturation and the least work for crystallization thereafter are
comparable in magnitude.

2.2. Power production from salinity gradients

In this section, we analyze salinity-gradient power production
as a means of brine management. Thermodynamically, energy is
required to separate salt from water. By reversing the process, energy

can be generated when salt and water are mixed. Figure 7 shows
two reversible, blackbox systems: one separating seawater into pure
water and brine (denoted here as 步mp and 步md,in , respectively), and
the other one mixing the brine and pure water streams. A reversible
desalination system requires the thermodynamic minimum amount
aration [30,40]. In this paper, the least work is denoted by 步W least
of energy input, which is sometimes referred to as least work of sep-
.
The reversible mixer generates the maximum amount of energy
by mixing the streams at the given salinities because there is no
entropy generation and associated lost work [41]. By virtue of being
reversible systems, the least work ( 步W least
) is exactly the same as that
of energy produced from mixing ( 步W max
Using the system conguration outlined in Fig. 7, generating more
energy from mixing than the least work violates the Second Law of
an appropriate salinity and ow rate, 步mf,in , is used for energy gen-
thermodynamics. However, if a different relatively purer stream at
eration, more energy can be generated than the separation energy
without violating the Second Law. We show this using a purely
thermodynamic construct. Fig. 8 shows a schematic diagram of this
process.
The system outlined in Fig. 8 consists of the same two blackbox
systems: one for desalination and another for power production. As
these systems are analyzed by the control-volume method, what is
happening inside the blackbox is not relevant. The First and Second
Laws of thermodynamics can be applied to each system. Following
the same approach as in Section 2 to combine the First and Sec-
ond Law equations results in Eqs. (10) and (11) for desalination and
power production systems, respectively:

of these dimensionless variables, Eqs. (10) and (11) can be recast into
following forms by dividing both sides by 步mp :

without violating the Second Law of thermodynamics.

3. Process-specic implementations

3.1. Zero-discharge desalination

In this section, we analyze a representative state-of-the-art real
world implementation of zero-discharge desalination (ZDD) system,
which consists of brine concentration and crystallization steps.
To quantify how close the practical systems are to the thermody-
namic limit, we calculated their Second Law eciencies. The Second
Law eciency for a chemical separation system is dened as the ratio
of the least exergy of separation to the exergy input to the system:

gII √ least exergy of separation
exergy input

(17)

( 步W least

The least exergy of separation is equal to the least work of separation
) which is a function of the salinities of the process streams
irrespective of the type of energy input [31]. For the separation pro-
cesses of brine concentration and crystallization, the least work was
given in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively for which the inlet and outlet
streams are assumed to have the same temperatures, T0 . The exergy
input to the system depends on the denition of the system and its
control volume. Following the approach of [31], the First and Sec-
ond Laws of thermodynamics can be applied to the system shown in
Fig. 10.

the control volume is treated as being suciently large that the pro-

at the dead state temperature (T0 ) and pressure (P0 ), which requires
heat transfer to the environment, ( 步Q0 ). (For discussion of the control

The left-hand side of Eq. (20) is the exergy input into the sys-
tem required for the desired separation of the process streams into
the specied salinities at the dead state temperature and pressure.
The second term, 步QH
1  T0
, is the exergetic value of 步QH . The scalar
1  T0
multiplier
is the Carnot eciency (less than unity), which
accounts for the fact that a heat input has a lower exergetic value
than a work input. The conversion of heat to its exergetic value is
conceptually achieved by operating a reversible heat engine between
the heat source at TH and heat sink at T0 . The heat engine converts 步QH
reversibly into work with a magnitude equal to the exergetic value
of the heat input.
Substituting the least work and the left-hand side of Eq. (20) into
Eq. (17) results in a denition of Second Law eciency of separation
system which takes energy inputs in the form of work and/or heat.

Now that we have the denition of Second Law eciency, we
can evaluate specic technologies for brine concentration and crys-
tallization. Seawater feed is rst concentrated from 35 g/kg to sat-
uration using a single-effect mechanical vapor compression (MVC)
system followed by crystallization using a 6-effect thermal evap-
orator. For the brine concentration step, a two-effect MVC system
was also studied. The technologies that we chose are to the best of
our knowledge, the most frequently used and state-of-the-art tech-
nologies in the industry. While MVC systems can be operated with
greater than two effects, systems with greater than two effects are
not common.
Figure 11 shows the schematic diagram of both systems and their
control volumes (dashed box). To be consistent with the control vol-
ume analysis in Fig. 10, all the streams in Fig. 11 enter and leave
at dead state temperature and pressure. As a result, when the brine
stream leaves the control volume on the left-hand side and reenters
the control volume on the right-hand side, the temperature is T0 .
This is also consistent with the multi-effect evaporator data obtained
from [11] which has streams entering at a temperature of T0 . In prac-
tice, the stream leaving the regenerator of the MVC system does not
need to be cooled all the way to T0 before reentering the crystallizer.
But this cooling is small compared to the heat input ( 步Qin ) in any case.

3.1.1. Mechanical vapor compression brine concentration
The work and heat transfer rates required for the MVC system
and the evaporator were obtained from modeling work and from the
literature, respectively. An existing model for MVC [43] was used to
calculate the work required to concentrate seawater from 35 g/kg
to saturation using a single-effect MVC system. The model itself is
based on an earlier work by El-Dessouky [44]. Properties for aqueous
sodium chloride were obtained from an implementation of Pitzer＊s
equations [37]. Parameters used for modeling as well as the results
are given in Table 1. The eciency of the compressor (gcomp ) was set
to 70% and the evaporator temperature (Tevap ) was set to 346 K. The
terminal temperature difference (DTTTD ) in the evaporator and the
pre-heaters was 3 K. The brine and the product water streams were
assumed to leave the pre-heater at the same temperature [44]. The
streams were found to leave the pre-heaters around 15 K above the
environment temperature T0 . In stand-alone MVC systems, typically,
the exergy within these streams are not extracted, and heat transfer
to the environment is allowed so that the streams eventually reach
a temperature T0 . This corresponds to the heat transfer rate of 步Q0 ,

Second Law eciency ranges from 0 to 1; completely reversible
systems have a Second Law eciency equal to unity. A low Second
Law eciency indicates that there is a high potential to improve the
system, in other words, to effect greater separation with the same
energy inputs.

Sedivy [11] as well as the outputs. Sedivy had reported the ther-
mal energy input to the system qcrys and the temperature at which
the input is occurring (TH ). The Second Law eciency of the thermal
evaporator crystallizer was calculated using Eq. (23). From the pro-
cedure outlined in Section 2, the least work for crystallization (wleast
was found to be 29.2 kJ/kg. The calculated Second Law eciency of
the thermal evaporator was 24.4%. The data in the literature did not
report electric work required for pumping and other peripheral oper-
ation. Compared to the exergy of the thermal input, the parasitic
power requirements were assumed to be negligible. This assumption
is consistent with models for thermal desalination systems in the
literature [40].
The heat source temperature used in this study is 453 K. Because
multi-effect evaporator＊s highest temperature is typically main-
tained at 343 K, a temperature difference of 110 K is driving the heat
transfer from which the multi-effect evaporator system receives the
heat input. This generates signicant amount of entropy, reducing
the Second Law eciency.
Figure 12 shows a hypothetical scenario where the heat source
temperature is varied while the same quantity of heat input is
used. The Second Law eciency of the multi-effect evaporator sys-
tem increases from 24.4% to 41.4% as the heat source temperature
decreases from 453 K to 373 K. Therefore, when low grade thermal
energy is available (e.g., low pressure steam), it is thermodynami-
cally much more favorable to utilize it. Smaller temperature differ-
ence entails larger heat exchanger area in order to maintain the same
quantity of heat transfer. For the crystallization process, corrosion
resistant metal alloys and metals such as titanium are used for heat
exchange surfaces. Titanium in particular has been operationally
found to be a very reliable material, resistant to corrosion and ero-
sion at both high salinities and temperatures [45,46]. However, such
materials are expensive, and increasing the heat exchanger area may
signicantly increase the capital cost. Therefore, an economic opti-
mum should be used to decide the optimal temperature of the heat
source. Another way to look at this conclusion is that using cheaper
material that is resistant to corrosion and erosion has the potential
to increase the Second Law eciency by lowering the top tempera-
ture through an increase of heat exchanger area, and we believe that
identifying a cheaper material is worth further research.
A comparison of the nal calculated Second Law eciencies of the
MVC brine concentrators and the multi-effect evaporator crystallizer
is shown in Fig. 13. The least ecient system was the single-effect
MVC brine concentrator with a Second Law eciency of 8.5%. The
two-effect MVC system was marginally better with an eciency of

depicted in Fig. 11. The actual work required to operate the single-
effect MVC system per feed mass ow rate was 78.8 kJ/kg while the
least work was 6.7 kJ/kg leading to a Second Law eciency of 8.5%.
The Second Law eciency value of 8.5% obtained here also corre-
sponds approximately to the eciency values reported by Thiel et
al. [30].
MVC brine concentration systems are also deployed in ※forward
feed multiple effect§ congurations where the thermal energy
obtained from condensation of product water in one effect is used
to evaporate feed and generate vapor to be condensed in a sub-
sequent effect. To ascertain the performance improvement from
adding effects, a two-effect forward feed MVC system was also mod-
eled. The model combined elements from the single-effect MVC
system model described previously with a multi-effect distillation
system model developed earlier by El-Dessouky [44]. The input con-
ditions, constraints and assumptions used in the two-effect model
were identical to those used in the single-effect model. To make a fair
comparison, the evaporator in the rst effect of the two-effect system
was maintained at a temperature of 346 K, the same as the evap-
orator temperature in the one-effect system. The two-effect model
was validated against the results published by Thiel et al. [30]. Thiel
et al. found that the Second Law eciency of a two-effect MVC
system for concentrating produced water brine from 150 g/kg to
260 g/kg was around 30%. The model developed here gave approx-
imately the same eciency under those conditions. The validated
two-effect MVC model was then used to calculate the work required
to concentrate seawater from 35 g/kg to saturation. The results are
shown in Table 1. The actual work required to operate the two-effect
MVC system per feed mass ow rate was 57.3 kJ/kg while the least
work was 6.7 kJ/kg leading to a Second Law eciency of 11.6%.

pletely separates saturated solution into pure salt and water was

thermodynamic framework to a practical energy generation sys-
tem. One of the most promising systems to harness salinity-gradient
power is pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO). A schematic diagram of
PRO coupled with a desalination system is shown in Fig. 14.
We use the same blackbox system for desalination because we
want the results to be as general as possible without being con-
strained to a particular desalination technology. However, in this
section we will not assume the blackbox desalination system in
Fig. 14 to be reversible; instead, we apply a value representative
of state of the art SWRO systems. We do this to avoid combin-
ing a reversible input with an irreversible output. Finite difference
method was used to numerically model the PRO system in coun-
terow conguration. By using the nite difference method, the
transport equations reduce to differences instead of the original par-
tial differential equations for the energy and mass balances. The
PRO module is divided into a number of computational cells, which
have to be solved simultaneously. These nonlinear equations were
solved using Engineering Equation Solver (EES), which is a simulta-
neous equation solver based on Newton＊s method [47]. The modeling
approach follows Chung et al. [48] and is summarized here.
At a high level, the ultimate goal of the PRO model is the calcu-
lation of the power production. The local reverse salt ux and the
water ux at any axial location (x) can be calculated using Eqs. (24)
and (25), respectively [48]:
pd,m (x)  pf,m (x)  [Pd (x)  Pf (x)]

pressure, and sf,m are the salinities at the membrane surface on the
draw and feed sides. These salinity values account for the concentra-
tion polarization as shown in Eqs. (26) and (27), respectively [49]:

11.6%, while the six-effect thermal evaporator performed more than
twice as well with an eciency of 24.4%. The previous discussion
highlighted how the eciency of the crystallizer could be increased
further by increasing the heat transfer area and reducing the tem-
perature at which heat is being transferred to the crystallizer. The
analysis makes it clear that research efforts on improving the energy
eciency of zero-discharge desalination should focus on the ※brine
concentration§ step rather than the ※crystallization§ step given the
much more signicant room for improvement in the former.

3.1.3. Eciency gains from adding more effects to an MVC system
A natural question that follows from the above analysis is: could
increasing the number of effects in an MVC system make brine con-
centration as ecient as crystallization? We focused our analysis
on single-effect and two-effect MVC systems because to the best
of our knowledge they are the most deployed congurations glob-
ally. However, MVC systems with greater than two ※forward feed§
effects also exist. Our analysis of single-effect and two-effect MVC
systems showed that adding any more effects would improve the
eciency only incrementally. To conrm this, the two-effect model
we made was extended to three effects keeping all other condi-
tions the same. We found that for a three-effect system, the Second
Law eciency was 12.9%, corresponding to a 1.3% increase in e-
ciency as compared to the two-effect system. In comparison, moving
from a one-effect to a two-effect system had increased the Second
Lw eciency by 3.1%. Our model revealed interesting conceptual
insights that explained the decreasing returns per effect. With addi-
tional effects, the mass ow rate of vapor through the compressor
reduced proportionately. However, the compression ratio across the
compressor increased to account for the evaporator terminal tem-
perature difference and boiling point elevation contribution of each
additional effect. The overall effect was that the compressor work
reduced only marginally with each additional effect. Extending the
trend seen in Second Law eciency values with the number of
effects, we estimated that the Second Law eciency of a six-effect
MVC system would be around 14%, far lower than the 24% seen for a
six-effect thermal crystallizer.

3.2. Pressure-retarded osmosis

In Section 2.2 we have seen that it is possible to generate more
energy than what is needed for desalination. We can apply the same

The power production from the turbine-generator assembly is:
步WPRO =
步mp

[Pd (L)  Po ]

q

(30)

where Pd (L) is the hydraulic pressure of the draw stream at the
draw exit and Po is the pressure of ambient state assuming the tur-
bine discharge pressure is the same as the ambient pressure. In the
PRO literature, the expression 步WPRO = JAmDP is commonly used to
calculated the power production, where Am is the total membrane
area [22,23,51]. However, this expression only applies for a zero-
dimensional system where axial variation of the pressure and the
osmotic driving force is negligible. For a module scale system, only
the pressure at the end of the draw channel (i.e., Pd (L)) is relevant for
power production.
In specifying the operating conditions, a functional form (dimen-
sional) of the power production equation is useful. 步WPRO (the depen-
dent variable) is a function of 6 variables: the minimum water ux
(Jmin ), the hydraulic pressure of the draw stream (Pd ), the ow rate
ratio (MR) and the velocity (v) of either stream [48]:
步WPRO = f (sd,in , sf,in , Jmin , v, Pd , MR)

(31)

In this study, the feed salinity (sf,in ) is xed at 1 g/kg, and the
draw salinity (sd,in ) is the independent variable (i.e., plotted as an
abscissa). Specifying the velocity of one steam (either draw or feed) is
sucient because the other stream＊s velocity is determined by mass
balance. The output power strongly depends on the choice of oper-
ating conditions. In order to generate general results, a wide range
of operating conditions should be considered. One possible solution
is using multi-variable optimization. In this paper, 3 variables (Pd , v
and MR) were chosen such that the power input (Ep ) is minimized.
Jmin was not used in the optimization because Ep is minimized as
Jmin approaches zero, which is clearly not economical as it implies
innite membrane area. Instead, several values of Jmin were used to
model practical systems. In addition, we included Jmin = 0 L/m2 h
as a limiting case. For optimization, the conjugate gradient method
was used [47]. Figure 15 summarizes the computational ow of the
combined PRO and desalination system.
Because the available seawater properties correlations [42] have
a maximum salinity level of 120 g/kg, we chose aqueous NaCl prop-
erties based on Pitzer＊s equations [37] to accurately model the effect
of salinity on the osmotic driving force.
Since we are interested in a PRO system coupled with desali-
nation, the metric of interest should quantify the energetic benet
of adding PRO to the desalination system. The net energy input to
the coupled system normalized by the pure water production from
desalination represents the energy savings. However, in order to
avoid directly comparing the irreversible energy output from PRO

to the reversible energy input to the desalination system we need
to estimate the energy input to the desalination system. The state-
of-the-art seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) systems have energy
consumptions about 3每4 kW h/m3 (normalized by pure water pro-
duced) of which about 1 kW h/m3 is used for pretreatment [52]. This
corresponds to a Second Law eciency value of about 30% [40,53]. In
general, the Second Law eciency of an RO system depends on the
feed salinity in a nontrivial manner. Second Law eciency increases
with feed salinity up to about 200 g/kg then decreases with further
increase in feed salinity, as discussed by Thiel et al. [30]. According to
Eq. (21), the energy input to the desalination system can be approxi-
mated as Ein = Eleast
in /gII . Then the net energy input to the integrated
desalination and PRO system is given by Eq. (32).

Enet √ Ein  Ep

(32)

pure water production (i.e., Ep √ 步WPRO q/ 步mp ). The net energy is nor-
where Ep is the PRO power normalized by the volume of desalination
malized by the pure water production ( 步mp ) because 步mp is the nal
product of the entire system. This normalization is useful because we
can directly compare Enet to the desalination energy consumption.
Figure 16 shows the net energy consumption without PRO and
with PRO for three levels of Jmin . AsJ min increases, the system size
decreases. In terms of economics, the whole cost of the system has
to be minimized, which means that both capital cost and energetic
cost should be accounted for. Energetic cost is minimized as Jmin
approaches zero whereas capital cost is minimized as Jmin is max-
imized. Therefore, an economic optimum exists at an intermediate
value of Jmin . Because PRO is not a well-established technology, it is
hard to determine what value of Jmin corresponds to an economic
optimum. If we infer from a representative reverse osmosis (RO)
average ux 14 L/m2 h [52], the practical Jmin value may lie between
10 and 20 L/m2 h. Along with the Jmin values of 10 and 20 L/m2 h,
Fig. 16 also shows the 0 L/m2 h case. We used a ux of 0.001 L/m2 h
to approximate 0 L/m2 h in our numerical models.
For the case with Jmin = 10 L/m2 h, energy saving by adding the
PRO unit is uniform over a wide range of salinities. For example,
0.42 and 0.43 kW h/m3 of energy saving are possible with the Jmin =
10 L/m2 system for 70 and 260 g/kg draw salinity, respectively. This
corresponds to 6 and 11% of the desalination energy input (Ein ). For
the Jmin = 0 L/m2 h case, more energy saving is possible when the
draw salinity is lower. The opposite trend is observed for Jmin =
20 L/m2 h case. This is because PRO power increases more with draw
salinity when the minimum ux is higher.
For all the cases, energy saving is not signicant, as shown in
Fig. 16. PRO＊s energy saving is not very sensitive to the minimum
ux. In particular, when the draw salinity is high, the net energy
consumption tends to converge. This trend suggests that large min-
imum ux values can be used without signicant energetic penalty.

Fig. 16. Specic energy consumption for desalination system without coupled PRO
and with PRO.

Because capital expenditure (CapEx) is the dominant cost factor for
PRO [48], increasing the minimum ux (or decreasing the system
size) can be an effective way to reduce the overall cost. Ultimately,
the savings from operating expenditure (OpEx) in the form of energy
reduction should be compared to the additional CapEx of the PRO
unit to determine the economic viability of coupling PRO to a desali-
nation system.

3.2.1. Osmotic driving force
Because the energy saving from the PRO unit is not signicant
(6每11% of the desalination energy), one natural way to increase the
energy saving is by increasing the system size of the PRO unit, which
reduces the overall driving force within the system, which in turn
reduces the irreversibilities. For this study, increasing the system
size is equivalent to decreasing the minimum ux, Jmin . As shown in
Fig. 16, when Jmin is reduced from 10 to 0 L/m2 h, the energy saving is
only slightly increased. This indicates that the membrane area is not
utilized in an effective manner. In other words, the osmotic driving
force within the PRO module is not well-distributed.
Figure 17 visualizes the osmotic driving force with Jmin = 0 L/m2 h
and Jmin = 10 L/m2 h. The osmotic driving force is the difference
between the net osmotic pressures which are dened as Pnet = PP
for each stream. The osmotic pressure at the membrane surface is
used to correctly quantify the driving force. When Jmin is 10 L/m2
h, the osmotic driving force is relatively uniformly distributed, and
further increase in the system size only perturbs this distribution.
Therefore, the marginal return of increasing the system size is small.
As a result, the combined PRO-desalination system does not produce
net energy even with Jmin = 0 L/m2 h unlike the reversible blackbox
mixer in Fig. 8. The PRO system is an irreversible system, and it has
a large membrane area, which results in zero driving force only at
one end of the PRO system. However, zero driving force at one loca-
tion does not imply that the system is reversible because osmosis
occurs through a nite osmotic pressure difference throughout the
system, which generates entropy. A completely reversible system
is one in which the driving force is everywhere zero. The driving
force in this case is the difference between the net osmotic pres-
sures (i.e., Pnet,d  Pnet,f = (Pd,m  Pd )  (P f,m  Pf )). The hydraulic
pressure on both sides is relatively constant assuming that viscous
losses are small compared to the osmotic pressure, which varies
along the length of the system due to variation in the salinities of
the streams. In order to cancel the driving force everywhere in the
system, the hydraulic pressure difference has to continuously equal

the osmotic pressure difference. The PRO system that was modeled
raises the pressure of the draw solution only once before it enters
the module (hence the single-pressure operation), which is why the
driving force is nite throughout the system except at one end of
the module (for the case of Jmin = 0 L/m2 h) as shown in Fig. 17a.
Because each data point in Fig. 16 is a result of optimization,
changing the operating conditions will not result in a decrease in
the net energy input. This suggests that the single-pressure oper-
ation, which is by far the most widely studied conguration, does
not have much potential to save signicant energy from a desali-
nation plant (limited to about 0.42 kW h/m3 ). In PRO literature, not
many researchers have considered module-scale operation. Most of
the studies use coupon-scale system where the osmotic driving force
is virtually uniform inside the system [22,23,51]. Few researchers
studied the variation of the osmotic driving force of a module-scale
system. For example, Banchik et al. developed the concept of mass
transfer unit (MTU) to properly represent the difference between
coupon and module-scale systems [29,54]. This is why the limita-
tion of single stage operation resulting from its poor distribution of
driving force has not been stressed. Different congurations such
as multistaging or batch operation can distribute the osmotic driv-
ing force more effectively over the PRO module. Therefore, these
congurations may have potential to increase the energy saving.

4. Conclusions

Two distinctly different ways of managing desalination brine are
analyzed from an energetic perspective: zero-discharge desalination
(ZDD) with salt production and electricity generation utilizing the
exergy of the brine. Thermodynamic minimum energy required for
ZDD process was calculated. In particular, energy required for brine
concentration stage was compared to that required for crystalliza-
tion to identify which stage has greater potential for improvement.
State-of-the-art technologies for brine concentration and crystalliza-
tion were analyzed using the concept of Second Law eciency.
For energy generation, we applied the First and Second Laws
of thermodynamics to reversible, blackbox systems. Then the same
analysis was applied to a practical salinity-gradient system, PRO. A
detailed numerical model for the PRO was used along with a non-
linear optimization to determine the optimal operating conditions.
The energy saving by adding a PRO unit to a desalination system was
quantied.
Our primary results are as follows:

Blackbox (reversible) systems
 The least work required for concentrating a feed until satura-
tion and then for completely crystallizing saturated brine was

similar even though the volume reduction achieved in the crys-
tallization step is around an order of magnitude smaller than

that achieved in the brine concentration step.
tion and that required for complete crystallization thereafter,
are comparable in order of magnitude for feed salinities up to
120 g/kg.
 Reversible systems can generate more energy from mixing the
desalination brine with an independent stream at low salinity
and high ow rate, than the energy required for desalination.

Process-specic implementations
 State-of-the-art crystallizers were found to be more ecient
than state-of-the-art brine concentrators. While a 6-effect
thermal evaporator had a Second Law eciency of 24.4%, a

with a desalination system cannot produce net positive energy,
in contrast to the reversible blackbox mixer because of inherent
irreversibilities associated with a nite osmotic driving force.
 The single-pressure operation of PRO has an ineffectively dis-
tributed osmotic driving force over the module. Different con-
gurations such as multistaging or batch operation may have
potential because they distribute the osmotic pressure in a
more effective way.

With a proper understanding of the energetic aspects of zero-
discharge brine management and salinity-gradient power production,
the natural next step is an economic analysis because economic via-
bility will ultimately determine the adoption of any technology. In
addition to the traditional costs associated with these technologies,
location-dependent factors, such as the prices of energy, salt, and
water, should be taken into account. Low energy prices, and high prices
of salt and water will push for the adoption of ZDD, and the opposite
will favor the adoption of salinity-gradient power generation.
