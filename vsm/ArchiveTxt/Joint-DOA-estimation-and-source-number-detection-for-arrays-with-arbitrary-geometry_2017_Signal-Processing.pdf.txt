abstract
In this paper, we focus on the problem of joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and source number 
detection for an array of sensors. We propose a CLEAN-based sequential algorithm that uses a sequential 
hypothesis testing procedure. This method can be employed for any array with an arbitrary geometry. 
We also manage to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method. Additionally, we de- 
rive an analytical performance bound for the source number detection algorithm. Our simulation results 
show that the proposed method achieves an appropriate performance even for low SNR or small num- 
ber of snapshots. It is shown that the proposed method is applicable to both correlated and uncorrelated 
sources. Unlike popular methods, the algorithm does not require to know the number of sources for the 
DOA estimation and is able to estimate the number and the DOA of sources jointly.

1. Introduction 

Array signal processing has applications in areas such as 
radar, sonar, wireless communication, radio astronomy, seismology, 
acoustics, and medical imaging [1,2] . Two of the most important 
problems in the array signal processing are the direction-of-arrival 
(DOA) estimation and source number detection. Due to the cost, 
available space and system performance in practical scenarios, it 
tends to be unsuitable to restrict the array geometry to a certain 
class. Therefore, the methods that can be applied to arbitrary array 
geometries are in great demand [3,4] . 
For the DOA estimation problem, the multiple signal classi- 
cation (MUSIC) algorithm [5] is one of the well-known subspace- 
based methods. This algorithm can be applied to any type of array 
geometry. A version of this algorithm, which is referred to as root- 
MUSIC, utilizes polynomial rooting [6] . However, this method is 
only applicable to the uniform linear array (ULA). In [7] a method 
is presented to extend the application of the root-MUSIC to the 
nonuniform linear array case. Fourier-domain root-MUSIC is an- 
other method which develops the root-MUSIC algorithm for DOA 
estimation in the sensor arrays of an arbitrary geometry [8] . An- 
other popular technique for DOA estimation is the estimation of 
signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) [9] . 
In the ESPRIT method, the array geometry is required to be shift 
invariant which limits the application of this method to a certain 
class of arrays. Array interpolation is a DOA estimation technique 
employed for nonuniform arrays [10¨C12] . This method involves ap- 
plying transformation to the received signal in order to obtain an 
interpolation of the signal over a virtual ULA. Manifold separation 
technique [13] models the received waveform by means of an or- 
thogonal expansion and approximates the true array steering vec- 
tor as the product of a matrix that depends only on the array pa- 
rameters and a Vandermond vector which depends merely on the 
angle of arrival. 
Some other DOA estimation methods are based on a technique 
called CLEAN [14] . CLEAN is developed initially for radio astron- 
omy. The main idea of CLEAN is to remove the strongest signals 
from the observed data successively. In [15] , a simple version of 
CLEAN method is applied to the DOA estimation problem. In this 
simple version, the cancellation of signal components is not per- 
fect and as a result, the performance of DOA estimation degrades. 
In [3] , a method is proposed for DOA estimation in nonuniform 
linear arrays. This method is a combination of CLEAN, Root-MUSIC 
and Toeplitz Completion techniques. However, this method needs 
an initial estimate of DOA of sources and the number of sources 
must be known. 
A popular sequential search technique for nding a sparse so- 
lution is orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [16] . This method can 
be utilized for DOA estimation. 
Source signals are correlated on condition that multipath reec- 
tions are present. When the source signals are correlated, the sig- 
nal covariance matrix may become rank-decient and many of the 
mentioned methods fail to nd the source DOA [3] . Certain meth- 
ods such as forward-backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) [18] can be 
used to improve the rank. The FBSS is one of the best methods to 
deal with the correlated sources, particularly when ULAs are con- 
sidered [3] . The disadvantage of this technique is that it uses the 
subarrays and therefore the resulting covariance matrix size is less 
than the original covariance matrix size. It must also be pointed 
out that the FBSS cannot be used directly for an array with an ar- 
bitrary geometry. 
Regarding the source number detection problem, the mini- 
mum description length (MDL) method [19] is one of the most 
successful methods. Another popular method is Akaike informa- 
tion criterion (AIC) [20] . These methods share common origins in 
the information-theoretic and Bayesian formulation of the general 
model selection problem [19] . The MDL and AIC are known to suf- 
fer in the detection performance for the small number of snap- 
shots. 
In this paper, we propose a CLEAN-based algorithm by solving a 
sequential generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to estimate both 
DOA and the number of sources. This method can be used for ar- 
rays with an arbitrary geometry. Moreover, we reduce the compu- 
tational complexity of the proposed method. An analytical perfor- 
mance bound for source number detection is also derived. It has 
been illustrated that the proposed technique has an appropriate 
performance in the case of small snapshots for two closely spaced 
targets. The proposed method is applicable to both correlated and 
uncorrelated sources. It is noteworthy that the proposed method is 
a CLEAN-based algorithm that is developed through an statistical 
approach by solving a sequential generalized likelihood ratio test. 
It is also worth mentioning that although some versions of CLEAN 
exist in the literature, there appear to be very few statistical stud- 
ies about this method [15] . To the best of our knowledge, no other 
method in the literature looks at the CLEAN algorithm from the 
GLRT point of view. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 describes the signal model. The proposed method for the 
joint DOA estimation and source number detection is presented 
in Section 3 . Section 4 is presented to reduce the computational 
complexity of the proposed method. The performance bound of 
the proposed source number detection algorithm, is analyzed in 
Section 5 . Simulation results, presented in Section 6 , explore the 
validation of the theoretical results. Finally, Section 7 concludes 
the paper.

2. The signal model 

Consider an array of M omnidirectional sensors with nonuni- 
form spacing in the xy plane. Assume that this array receives sig- 
nals from L ( L

known DOAs, 
T . We intend to estimate the number

3. The proposed method 

In order to estimate the number of sources, we propose a se- 
quential algorithm which results from the solution of a sequential 
composite hypothesis testing problem. Solving this problem at the 
 th stage will determine whether there is a source in the direc- 
tion of 
 or not. The presence or absence of this source must be 
determined in the presence of the other sources in the unknown 
1 . The hypothesis testing problem at the 
direction of 
 th stage can be modeled as

Please note that the last stage of the step 2 is added to improve the 
performance of the DOA estimation and source number detection, 
especially when there are strong sources. In this case, the men- 
tioned stage improves the signal components cancellation and as a 
result, the residuals will be suciently small.

In this section, rst we develop a recursive form for P 
given 
by (6) and then we employ Fourier series expansion and discrete 
Fourier transform (DFT) to reduce the computational complexity of

the computational complexity of the proposed method.

The order of the computational complexities of the proposed 
method and spectral MUSIC have been compared in Table 1 . Note 
that the computational complexity of the eigen-decomposition

¦È ) 
tional complexity of the proposed method, rst we calculate f (

repeated L times and also note that K 1 
marized in Table 1 . 
As can be seen from Table 1 , the computational complexities 
of the methods depend on the scenario and array parameters. 
The value of K 1 
must be chosen to make sure that the errors 
caused by the angular grid step size are negligible relative to the 
value of the RMSE. Consider a numerical scenario where the num- 
ber of elements is M

this scenario spectral MUSIC needs more computations than the 
proposed method. Please note that the spectral MUSIC algorithm 
must be accompanied by an enumeration algorithm. Consequently, 
the computational complexity of this enumeration algorithm must 
be added to that of spectral MUSIC method but the proposed 
method estimates the number and the DOA of the sources 
jointly.

5. Performance analysis 

One of the most important metrics in the performance analy- 
sis of a source enumeration algorithm is the probability of correct 
detection of the number of sources. In this section, we derive a 
performance bound on the probability of correct detection by as- 
suming that the directions of the sources are known. Given the 
number of sources is equal to L , the conditional correct detection 
probability can be stated as:

It is noteworthy that the values of the thresholds at each stage 
are dependent on the false alarm probability ( P fa 
) and the value of 
false alarm probability will affect the correct detection probability. 
In fact, in the proposed method, the correct detection probability 
is obtained from the product of the detection probability at each 
stage and 1 
of the nal stage. Therefore, the probability of 
false alarm must be selected in such a manner that the probabil- 
ity of detection becomes suciently large at each stage while P fa 
remains small enough.

6. Simulation results 

In this section, a number of numerical examples are presented. 
For DOA estimation performance analysis, the Root Mean Square 
Error (RMSE) is considered. For each of the performance compar- 
isons, 10 0 0 independent Monte Carlo trials have been used. In DOA 
estimation performance examples, the comparison is made among 
the proposed method, the spectral MUSIC and OMP for uncorre- 
lated sources, and also FBSS and OMP for fully correlated sources. 
The benchmark is considered to be the Cramer Rao bound (CRB) 
[3] . In addition, for the source number detection examples, the 
proposed method is compared with the MDL method. The range of

Fig. 1 demonstrates the DOA estimation RMSEs of the proposed 
method, spectral MUSIC and OMP versus the sensor signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR). The number of snapshots is set to be N 
 10 . Two 
equal power uncorrelated signal sources are assumed to impinge 
5 
on the array from the directions 
and 
 10 
. A nonuni- 
form array (NUA) of 12 sensors is considered. This type of array 
geometry is designed in [23] for azimuthal DOA estimation. The 
locations of sensors of this array are given in Table 2 . It can be 
seen from Fig. 1 that the proposed method outperforms the OMP 
and spectral MUSIC. OMP performance increases with a very small

cancellation is not done properly due to the DOA estimation error 
of the previous stage. Therefore, the signal residuals are not suf- 
ciently small and affect DOA estimation performance of the next 
stage. The similar simulation with different number of sources is 
considered in Fig. 2 . The number of sources is considered to be 
three in this simulation. The same performance behavior is ob- 
served as previous example.

sidered to be uncorrelated in this example. It is observed that the 
performance of the proposed method is better in comparison with 
the spectral MUSIC and OMP method. As it can be seen, that the 
spectral MUSIC does not have a good performance when the num- 
ber of snapshots is small. This is due to the fact that in this case 
an accurate estimation of the sample covariance matrix is not pro- 
vided. 
In Fig. 4 there are two uncorrelated sources, one is xed at 
10 
to 30 ¡ã. The SNR is equal 
 10 
and the other sweeps from 
to 10 dB and the array geometry is the same as the rst exam- 
ple. As can be seen, the proposed method has a better perfor-

mance in comparison with the spectral MUSIC and OMP for two 
closely located sources. It can be seen that the proposed method 
and the OMP, encounter a performance degradation in some source 
angles. The reason of this performance degradation is that these 
two methods can be seen as a type of spatial ltering technique. 
Therefore, this degradation in some source angles results from the 
side lobe effects. The location and amount of performance degra- 
dation depends on array geometry, SNR value and the DOA esti- 
mation method. Spectral MUSIC is based on the signal and noise 
subspaces. Consequently, the performance behavior of this method 
is different from the proposed method and OMP. 

For fully correlated sources, the same scenarios as in the Figs. 1, 
3 and 4 are considered in Figs. 5¨C7 , respectively. Since the sources 
are fully correlated, the spectral MUSIC method fails. Therefore, in 
these simulations the comparison is carried out between the pro- 
posed method, the FBSS and OMP methods. It should be noted that 
the FBSS method is solely applicable to uniform arrays. Hence, we 
have considered a ULA with M 
 12 and a sensor spacing equal 
to 
. It is seen that the proposed method usually outperforms 
the FBSS and OMP methods in the fully correlated source case. 
In Fig. 8 a single snapshot scenario is considered. The sources are

fully correlated. As it can be seen, the proposed method is also ap- 
plicable to the single snapshot case. 
We consider a two-dimensional scenario in Fig. 9 . Two uncor- 
5 
related sources are assumed at the directions ( 
 60 
) 
and ( 
 10 
 70 
). This gure demonstrates the RMSEs in 
¦È directions versus SNR for the proposed method. As it can be 
and 
seen, we can apply the proposed method to the two-dimensional 
scenarios. Fig. 10 shows the probability of correct detection of the 
number of sources versus SNR. The false alarm probability is set to 
0.01 in each stage. As a result, the maximum value of correct de- 
tection probability tends to be 0.99, which is a suitable value for 
correct detection probability. The threshold values are obtained by 
the Monte Carlo simulations to achieve the mentioned false alarm 
probability. Note that the noise variance is assumed to be known 
a priori. It is observed that there is a dramatic performance differ- 
ence between the proposed method and the MDL method. It can 
also be observed that the performance gap between the proposed 
method and the analytical performance bound derived in Eq. (29) , 
is about 2 dB. It should be noted that the probability of correct 
detection of the proposed method is obtained using Monte Carlo 
simulation. In Fig. 11 , one source is xed at 
 10 
and the other 

¦È =

sweeps from 
to 30 ¡ã with SNR 
 0 dB. It can be seen that 
the proposed method can provide a better source number detec- 
tion when the sources are close to each other. In Fig. 12 , the num- 
ber of sources is three. The directions of two sources are xed at 
10 
 10 
 30 
and the third source sweeps from 
to 50 ¡ã
with SNR 
 0 dB. It can be seen that the proposed method has a 
good performance in the case of three sources.

7. Conclusion 

In this paper we proposed a sequential algorithm to solve 
the problem of the joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and 
source number detection for arrays with arbitrary geometry. This 
algorithm results from solving a sequential hypothesis testing 
problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm usu- 
ally has a performance better than the spectral MUSIC and FBSS 
method in the case of low SNR or small number of snapshots. In 
addition, the performance of the proposed method in source num- 
ber detection is usually better than the MDL method. 

Appendix A. Derivation of relation (5) 

In order to solve the hypothesis testing problem (3) , we apply 
a suitable transformation to the received signal. Using this trans- 
formation, the unknown parameters will be reduced to only two 
parameters that are s (cid:6)
 ( n ) and the azimuth direction of the 
 th 
source. To do this, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) 
to rewrite A (cid:6)
1 as

Appendix B. Proof of Lemma 1 

In order to show that 
(x

 and 
(x 
)
of each other, we use the following theorem. 
¡Á 1 complex vector with the probability 
Theorem 1. Let z be an M 
¡Á M Hermitian 
(
)
density function 
 and let B and D be the M 
matrices. If BCD 
 then the second-order statistics z 
H Bz and z 
are independent of each other [25] .
