abstract

This study aimed at investigating the desalination performance of ion exchange membranes (IEMs) treating
polymer ooding wastewater and inuence of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) molecular weights
(MWs) on membrane fouling. Adsorption of HPAM on IEMs and molecular weight distributions (MWDs) of
HPAM in chemical cleaning solutions were analyzed to study IEM fouling characteristics. Experimental results in-
dicated that HPAM affected the desalination performance most signicantly compared to oil. Moreover, cation
exchange membranes (CEMs) were easier to be polluted by HPAM with lower MWs while anion exchange mem-
branes (AEMs) were easier to be polluted by HPAM with higher MWs. It was also found that the heterogeneous
IEM fouling caused by HPAM was more severe than the homogeneous IEM. Furthermore, CLSM, FTIR, electrostatic
interaction and interface thermodynamics analysis indicated that HPAM caused membrane fouling and the main
mechanism was electrostatic interaction.

1. Introduction

As one of the enhanced recovery (EOR) technologies, polymer
ooding has been widely utilized in oil production industry to efciently
recover the remaining oil left in oil reservoirs, especially in China [1每3].
By dissolving polymers in injected water, the viscosity increases and the
mobility ratio between the ooding water and the reservoir oil alters,
thus enhancing the sweep efciency and the oil recovery rate. However,
polymer ooding technology has produced million tons of wastewater
with high water content and complex composition of pollutants, includ-
ing HPAM, crude oil, suspended solids and salts, which will cause ad-
verse effects to the environment without further treatment [3每5].
Moreover, considering the vast demand for fresh water to prepare the
HPAM ooding solution, it is reasonable to apply proper treatments to
polymer ooding produced water before recycling.
Our research group was the rst to introduce electrodialysis (ED)
into desalination of polymer ooding wastewater (with a treating ca-
pacity: 9600 t/d). After a series of conventional pretreatments (e.g. co-
agulation, sedimentation and ultraltration), suspended solids and oil
(b 1 mg/L in ultraltration efuent) in polymer ooding wastewater
can be removed mostly, thus not having a tendency to cause severe
fouling on IEMs. However, concentration of polymer in ultraltration ef-
uent may even be up to 60每100 mg/L. Also, high salinity of the ultral-
tration efuent can cause coiling up of the linear polymer chain, which
can reduce the thickening ability of HPAM, thereby making the
pretreated water not satisfy rejection criteria for preparing the poly-
meric solution and affecting the oil recovery rate [6每9]. Therefore, mea-
sures should be taken to lower the salinity of the pretreated water
before its reuse.
Electrodialysis (ED), an electrochemical technology, utilizing poten-
tial difference as the driving force for the separation of charged ions via
IEMs, is not only employed for desalination of brackish water and sea-
water, but also can be used for reclamation of acid/base from industrial
wastewater and removal of bromate from natural water [10每12]. ED,
having an edge both in efciency and cost, has enjoyed an increasing
popularity in treating polymer ooding produced water. Nevertheless,
electrodialysis (ED) inuent still contain a certain concentration of
HPAM after ultraltration which can cause membrane fouling in ED
process, thus seriously affecting desalination efciency and service life
of the ED stack [13每16]. Due to electrical interactions between the
membrane surface and foulants, AEMs were more susceptible to be
fouled by organic compounds [17每19], while CEMs may possibly be
fouled by mineral precipitates, such as calcium and magnesium salts
[20]. Membrane fouling in ED process depends on electrochemical and
physical properties of membranes and foulants, such as electric resis-
tance, transmembrane potential and zeta potential [21每23]. In addition,
recent studies showed that the fouling of inorganic salts on membranes
was reversible, mainly due to direct surface crystallization and/or pre-
cipitation [24], while organic molecules with benzene rings and xed
charged groups can result in an irreversible fouling caused by hydro-
phobic interactions between the benzene ring and the membrane poly-
mer [25]. Also, we prepared a table (Supplementary material, Table S2)
to show performance and fouling mechanism of ion exchange mem-
branes. Unfortunately, there were surprisingly few studies focusing on
fouling of HPAM with different MWs on IEMs and the fouling mecha-
nism was rarely analyzed deeply by previous studies.
In this research, we investigated inuence of HPAM MWs on IEMs
fouling by measuring desalination ratio, energy consumption, trans-
membrane potential and electrical resistance of IEMs. Crucial factors
inuencing desalination efciency were found out through investiga-
tion of electrostatic interaction, interface thermodynamics and MWs
of HPAM. This study will not only nd out the crucial factor affecting de-
salination, but also provide references for controlling membrane fouling
in treating polymer ooding wastewater by ED.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Experimental device

A six-compartment ED stack was designed and made to observe the
effect of HPAM with different MWs on desalting performance of IEMs.
Its diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1. The stack, which dimension was
W ℅ H ℅ D = 260 mm ℅ 60 mm ℅ 120 mm, was made of plexiglass.
Each IEM, with an effective membrane area of 60 cm2, was clipped tight-
ly by two splints and cushions, respectively. The stack was divided by
three CEMs and two AEMs into six compartments, among which com-
partments 1 and 6 were electrode compartments lled with 0.04 M
Na2SO4 solution. The second and fourth compartments were diluted
compartments, while the third and fth compartments were concen-
trated compartments, lled with feed water respectively. The lab-scale
experiments were conducted under a constant current of 80 A (the lim-
iting current density was 100 mA). The electrode, concentrated and di-
luted solution were pumped from different vessels with the same ow

rate of 9 mL/min by peristaltic pumps to their respective compartments
and efuents from these compartments owed back to their corre-
sponding vessels, thereby forming a circulation ow respectively. (See
Fig. 2.)
The solution conductivities in diluted compartments were measured
every 20 min.

2.2. Experimental material

2.2.1. Characterization of ion exchange membranes
This experiment adopted two kinds of IEMs, including heteroge-
neous IEMs (Hedun, China) and homogeneous IEMs (Tianwei, China).
Membrane properties are given in Table 1.

2.2.2. Feed water
Feed water was prepared by dissolving 200 mg/L HPAM with MWs
of 0.3, 0.8, 3.0 million Daltons respectively in 3000 mg/L NaCl electrode
solution. To further investigate the inuence of oil on the desalting per-
formance, 40 mg/L oil and 80 mg/L SDBS (to well disperse hydrophobic
oil in water) were added to feed water. The parameters of feed water
were shown in Table 2. The UF efuent still contain remaining oil inside,
so the inuence of oil on the desalting performance needs to be further
investigated. The crude oil was obtained from Daqing oileld and SDBS
was added to disperse oil in water.

2.3. Analytical methods

2.3.1. Transmembrane potential
Platinum wires were inserted at two sides of the AEMs and the
multi-meter was connected to the data terminal to measure transmem-
brane potentials under constant current in real time.

2.3.2. Membrane resistance
The membrane resistance was measured by the alternating current
bridge method [26]. The unused IEM was placed in a specially designed
cell containing 3000 mg/L NaCl solution to soak the membrane. Induc-
tance, capacitance and impedance (LCZ) meter, connecting to the elec-
trode clamps clipped at two sides of the cell by wires, was employed
to measure the resistance and the measurement was repeated without
the IEM. The membrane resistance was calculated as the difference of
readings with and without membrane.

2.3.3 Characterization of membrane fouling
Microstructures of IEMs were analyzed via the confocal laser scan-
ning microscope (CLSM) (Olympus FV1000, Olympus, Japan), and Fou-
rier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) (Nicolet 5700, Nicolet,
USA) was applied to substantiate the presence of HPAM on the IEMs
after fouling.

2.3.4 Zeta potentials of foulants
Zetasizer (Nano ZS90, Malvern, UK) was used to analyze zeta
potentials of different foulants.

2.3.5 Atomic force microscope (AFM)
Atomic force microscope system (MultiMode8, Bruker, Germany)
was applied to test the force-distance curves between IEMs and
HPAM. Peak Force QNM operation mode was adopted.

2.3.6 Contact angles
Goniometer (JC2000D1, Zhongchen, China) was employed to mea-
sure contact angles of foulants and IEMs in ultra-water, formamide
and diiodomethane solution respectively. The inuence of thermody-
namics interaction on membrane fouling between HPAM and IEMs
were analyzed.
(1) Measurements of foulants: 10 g/L HPAM solution was smeared
on the slide and then the slide was dried under 38 ∼C to form a smear
layer. After that, contact angles were measured in different solutions.
(2) Measurements of IEMs: The IEMs were also dried under 38 ∼C
and was put smoothly on the slide. Then contact angles in different
solutions were measured.

2.3.7 Molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD)
A gel chromatography LC-10ADVP (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with
a TSK4000 separation column were used to test MWs and MWDs of
HPAM.

2.3.8 Interfacial free energy
Contact angles of Milli-Q water, formamide and diiodomethane
which were different in polarity were measured by dropping them on
the target and interfacial tension was calculated by expanded Young
equation (Eqs. (1)每(2)). Interfacial free energy (Eqs. (3)每(5)) was

3. Results and discussion

3.1 Inuence of HPAM on desalination performance of IEMs

3.1.1 Desalination ratio and energy consumption
Fig. 3 shows desalination rate curves in different feed solutions when
other operating conditions were kept constant. Heterogeneous IEM re-
vealed larger reduction in desalination efciency than homogeneous
IEM whatever MW of HPAM was dosed. It revealed that HPAM exerted
larger impact on heterogeneous membrane than homogeneous mem-
brane. HPAM remaining in inuent will decrease ion transference num-
ber of IEMs. The larger the MW of HPAM is, the smaller the transference
number is. This makes ions in solution hard to pass through IEMs. Thus,
desalination rate decrease signicantly with HPAM MW increasing and
heterogeneous membrane was inuenced more markedly than homo-
geneous membrane. Additionally, desalination ratios of oil-contained
solutions were much higher than feed water with HPAM (3.0 million)
treated by both heterogeneous and homogeneous membranes, indicat-
ing that the desalting performance was not very strongly inuenced by
oil compared to HPAM. Energy consumptions and current efciencies
under various conditions are shown in Fig. 4. As we can see from
Fig. 4(a), energy consumption of the heterogeneous IEMs was 1.04
kWh/m3 when the saline was treated without dosing HPAM, while
energy consumption increased to 1.22 kWh/m3, 1.37 kWh/m3 and
1.54 kWh/m3 after 0.3 million, 0.8 million and 3.0 million Daltons
HPAM were dosed respectively. These energy consumption results

were 17.31%, 35.20% and 48.08% higher than that of blank test respec-
tively. Therefore, the existence of HPAM not only reduced the desalina-
tion efciency, but also increased the energy consumption. With MWs
of HPAM increasing, the energy consumption rose. Results of homoge-
neous IEMs are shown in Fig. 4(b) which was similar to that of hetero-
geneous ones and changes of energy consumption with homogeneous
membrane were slighter than heterogeneous IEMs. It was probable
that HPAM addition changed membrane resistance of heterogeneous
membrane more substantially.
As for current efciency, when treating HPAM (3.0 million Daltons)
feed water, efciency of heterogeneous IEMs (Fig. 4(a)) reduced signif-
icantly to 68%. However, differences of current efciencies were
unobvious among results from feed water containing different MWs of
HPAM. Membrane limiting current together with diffusion coefcient
will decrease after fouled by HPAM. Therefore, current efciency de-
clined remarkably when wastewater was treated [28]. But variations
were slight for both homogeneous and heterogeneous IEMs, thus cur-
rent efciencies were not affected obviously when HPAM MW changed.

3.1.2 Transmembrane potential
Generally, organics in natural water have a negatively charged sur-
face which tend to adhere to AEMs with positively charged xed groups,
so that studies of organic pollution are always on AEMs [29,30]. After
membrane fouling, changes exist not only in conductivities, but also in
the structure of membrane-liquid double layer. Tanaka. Nobuyuki
et al. [31每34] studied variations of transmembrane potentials to mea-
sure the degree of membrane pollution. In order to study the fouling
of AEMs by different MWs of HPAM in desalination, transmembrane po-
tentials varying with time were studied (Fig. 5).
According to Fig. 5, transmembrane potentials of both two kinds of
AEMs increased as time went by, which indicated that membrane foul-
ing occurred during electrodialysis. For the same kind of membranes,
curves all went higher with increase of HPAM MW from 0.3 million,
0.8 million to 3.0 million Daltons. After heterogeneous AEMs had run

for 150 min, results of solution containing HPAM (0.3, 0.8, 3.0 million
Daltons) increased approximately 0.09 V, 0.19 V and 0.37 V respectively.
Therefore, the larger the MW of HPAM was, the stronger its adsorption
on the membrane was and the more serious the membrane fouling was.
Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 5(b), when HPAM MWs were 0.8 mil-
lion and 0.3 million Daltons, transmembrane potentials of heteroge-
neous AEMs increased to a certain value and remained stable, which
meant that the content of HPAM on AEMs stabilized at a certain value,
thus leading to the xedness of membrane resistance and the balance
of membrane fouling. However, when HPAM MW was 3.0 million Dal-
tons, transmembrane potentials of heterogeneous AEMs soared and
the growth rate was more drastic after remaining stable for some
time. Two reasons may account for this phenomenon: one was that
HPAM molecules adhered to the HPAM fouling layer on the membrane
surface, so that membrane fouling aggravated and the membrane resis-
tance rose quickly. The other was that platinum wires, measuring the
transmembrane potential, could only approach to the membrane sur-
face as near as possible instead of on it, making what is measured in-
clude both freshwater potentials and concentrated water potentials
other than the potential through the membrane itself. Ion concentra-
tions in diluted compartments decreased and the electric resistance of
the solution increased as time passed by. The potential of freshwater
surpassed the actual transmembrane potential of AEMs and became
dominant, thus resulting in the rapid rise. Referring to the desalination
result above, the desalination performance of the IEMs was the worst
in experiments using 3.0 million Daltons HPAM, which meant that the
decreasing rate of the ion concentration in it was slower than in 0.8 mil-
lion and 0.3 million Daltons HPAM solution. Therefore, freshwater po-
tential becoming dominant should appear the latest in 3.0 million
Daltons HPAM solutions. However, according to Fig. 5(b), transmem-
brane potential failed to rise continually after stabilization in 0.3 million
and 0.8 million Daltons HPAM solutions. Thus, the unique rapid rise
discussed here in 3.0 million Daltons HPAM solutions may be more like-
ly to be accounted for the rst reason. Furthermore, it was evident that

the fouling of HPAM on the heterogeneous AEMs was more severe by
comparison of Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b).

3.1.3 Membrane resistance
Organics mainly pollute AEMs, while calcium and magnesium ions
mainly pollute CEMs [35]. However, most polymeric membranes of
which surfaces are hydrophobic generally treat hydrophobic organics.
Organics approach membrane surfaces spontaneously as a result of
thermodynamics, which causes fouling on CEMs and membrane resis-
tance changed accordingly.
Experiments were conducted to test membrane resistances of IEMs
before and after being fouled by different feed water and results were
presented in Fig. 6. As we can see from results of AEMs in Fig. 6, mem-
brane resistances after fouling increased with increasing MWs of
HPAM [36,37]. Also, the growth rate of the membrane resistance of
AEMs fouled by 3.0 million Daltons HPAM was the fastest and the mem-
brane resistance of heterogeneous AEMs increased by 73.52%, markedly
exceeding results from heterogeneous AEMs fouled by HPAM of 0.8 mil-
lion Daltons (15.42%) and 0.3 million Daltons (6.54%). Similar results
were obtained from homogeneous IEMs. Conclusions can be drawn
that membrane fouling of AEMs strengthened with the increase of

HPAM MWs. As for CEMs, membrane resistances of heterogeneous
CEMs rose by 78.97%, 68.74% and 35.20% when HPAM MWs were 0.3
million, 0.8 million and 3.0 million Daltons respectively. So it was easier
for HPAM with lower MWs to foul CEMs. This may be due to that the
lower the HPAM MW was the easier the blocking of membrane pores
was. Therefore, HPAM with low MWs caused more severe fouling on
CEMs.
According to Fig. 6, the membrane resistances of both kinds of IEMs
in oil feed water were slightly larger than that in HPAM feed solution,
indicating that oil was easier to cause membrane fouling than HPAM.
This result seemed to be inconsistent with the result obtained from
the desalting performance. To further explain this, the adsorption of
oil and HPAM on the IEMs during the membrane fouling were studied
and results could be seen in Fig. S1. It was observed that the adsorption
of oil on the IEM was faster than HPAM at the same operating condition,
possibly because most of oil formed an oil lm on the membrane skele-
ton shortly. However, the membrane fouling caused by oil was a long-
term accumulation, thus leading to an unobvious inuence on ion mi-
grations and desalination ratios. It should be noted that the adsorption
of HPAM on the membrane by fouling of feed solution (containing Oil
and HPAM) was close to that of feed solution containing HPAM,

the heterogeneous AEMs. Therefore, CLSM results showed that HPAM
actually caused membrane fouling on AEMs. The extent of membrane
fouling on the surface of the heterogeneous AEMs was more severe
than the homogeneous AEMs.

3.2.2 FTIR analysis
Fig. 8 showed the FTIR spectra of the heterogeneous AEMs before
and after fouled by HPAM.

indicating that oil affected little on membrane fouling when treating
feed water containing HPAM and oil. Moreover, results (Supporting In-
formation, Text S1) of zeta potentials indicated that there was no inter-
action between oil and HPAM. The composition of foulants could be
complex if feed water containing oil was adopted to analyze inuence
of HPAM on membrane fouling. And we may fail to study interactions
between HPAM and the membrane. Therefore, we studied inuence of
HPAM on membrane fouling without emulsied oil added in feed
water. In further studies, we will study the inuence of feed water con-
taining salts, oil and HPAM on membrane fouling simultaneously.

3.2 Fouling characteristics and mechanism analysis of HPAM on IEMs

3.2.1 CLSM analysis
Because the fouling of AEMs was the most serious, CLSM was applied
to observe and analyze microstructures of AEMs before and after pollu-
tion by 3.0 million Daltons HPAM solutions [38,39]. Results were illus-
trated in Fig. 7.
As can be seen from Fig. 7(a) and (c), the surface of blank IEMs was
relatively smooth and the supporting layer of the IEMs can be seen
clearly. However, IEMs were not smooth any more after fouled by
HPAM (Fig. 7(b) and (d)), especially for the heterogeneous AEMs. The
surface of the heterogeneous AEMs adsorbed a layer of matters and
pore structures became obscure. In addition, the surface of the homoge-
neous AEMs also adsorbed a layer of matters obviously and pore struc-
tures also became obscure, but the membrane fouling was slighter than

which meant that the interaction between HPAM and CEMs fell as dis-
tance increased. However, curve (a) located above the ※zero force
line§ all the time, indicating that the interaction between HPAM and
IEMs was repulsive force during retraction. Curve (b) was completely
different from curve (a). Interaction force remained repulsive between
HPAM and IEMs at the beginning of retraction. But the repulsive force
dropped to zero suddenly when the probe moved upward and the inter-
action between HPAM and the IEMs was attractive. At the bottom of
curve (b), the attractive force reached maximum, roughly amounting
to the elastic force of the cantilever probe. Then the interaction between
HPAM and the IEMs dropped gradually until the perturbation of the
cantilever reached zero again. Therefore, HPAM on the probe tip
began to exhibit electrostatic interactions with IEMs, which were repul-
sive forces between HPAM and CEMs and attractive forces between
HPAM and AEMs. It reasonably explained the dominant role of the elec-
trostatic force in the interaction between HPAM and IEMs.

3.2.4 Interface thermodynamics interaction
Adhesion free energies of HPAM-membrane interface are shown in
Table 3. 忖Gplm represents for the adhesion free energy on the mem-
brane surface. 忖Gplm N 0 and 忖Gplm b 0 represent for the repulsive
force and the attractive force respectively [27]. The adhesive energy
忖Gplm were all negative valued under these three conditions and abso-
lute values were high, which indicated that HPAM were prone to adhere
together on the IEMs.
Table 3 shows interfacial energy of HPAM with different MW. 忖Gplp
represents cohesive energy between HPAM molecules. When
忖Gplp N 0, interaction force between molecules is repulsive. This force
is attractive when 忖Gplp b 0. According to Table 4, 忖Gplp values were
all negative which reveals HPAM molecules tend to cohere. The ranking
of absolute value of adhesion free energies between HPAM molecules
with different MWs, from high to low, were 0.3 million, 3.0million and
0.8 million Daltons according to the interface thermodynamics analysis,
which represented the adhesion ability of different kinds of HPAM mol-
ecules to each other in an order from strong to weak. Theoretically, vis-
cosity of solution with HPAM MW of 0.3 million should be the largest.
However, viscosity of HPAM solutions ranging from high to low was
that with solvent MW of 3.0 million, 0.3 million and 0.8 million Daltons,
because viscosity is also relevant with MWs. So, for HPAM with a MW of
3.0 million Daltons, the inuence of MW on viscosity was more signi-
cant than interactive forces between molecules. Also, continual increase
of transmembrane pressure after reaching a certain value in prior ex-
periment on solution with HPAM MW of 3.0 million can be accounted

for by the assumption that HPAM molecules can adhere to the fouling
layer of HPAM on the membrane surface, as viscosity of this kind of so-
lution is the largest. Thus, the interface thermodynamics interaction
contributed but slightly to the fouling of HPAM on IEMs, when AEMs
were especially less inuenced by the thermodynamics interaction.
Table 4 reveals contact angles, surface tension and HPAM-
membrane interface adhesion free energy (忖Gplm). For the same kind
of membrane, HPAM-membrane adhesion free energy were largest in
solution with solvent MW of 0.8 million Daltons, while that with solvent
MW of 3.0 and 0.3 million Daltons come the second largest and lowest
which is also the sequence of the tendency of different kinds of HPAM
molecules adhere to the membrane. But according to aforementioned
conclusion, HPAM with larger MW tends to pollute AEMs, while
HPAM with smaller MW tends to pollute CEMs. Interfacial thermody-
namics interaction contributes little to IEMs pollution and Van der
Waals force and acid-alkali force were less signicant than electrostatic
force. In addition, strong repulsive force exists between HPAM and
CEMs. HPAM can't pollute CEMs theoretically, but HPAM, especially
with smaller MW, will actually pollute CEMs. Interface thermodynamic
interaction can't completely explain this phenomenon. Other reasons
like physical plugging may account for it.
When comparing heterogeneous and homogeneous membranes,
exchange groups on the latter ones were more evenly distributed.
More unbalanced distribution of charges on heterogeneous AEMs may
cause more severe fouling of heterogeneous AEMs than homogeneous
AEMs. Charge density was high on some parts of heterogeneous AEMs.
Thus electrostatic force between HPAM and membrane was stronger
on these parts and pollution was more severe. As for fouling of hetero-
geneous CEMs more severe than homogeneous CEMs, the low charge
density on some parts of heterogeneous CEMs making repulsive force
with HPAM weaker on these parts may be reason for more severe foul-
ing of heterogeneous CEMs.

3.2.5 Inuence of MWs on membrane fouling
Long molecular chains are easy to be broken when preparing HPAM
solutions, so that actual MWs of HPAM in solution may no longer be 0.3,
0.8, 3.0 million Daltons as labeled. Therefore, experiments were con-
ducted to measure MWDs in 0.3, 0.8, 3.0 million Daltons HPAM solu-
tions respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 10.
IEMs possess bending pores penetrating inside membrane body
(tens to hundreds of nanometers in pore diameters). As dimensions of
HPAM molecules are much greater than membrane pores, HPAM are
hard to penetrate IEMs in transition, thus intercepted on the membrane
surface. When dimensions of HPAM are equal to or smaller than that of
membrane pores, HPAM are likely to block in membrane pores, and ag-
gravate membrane fouling. Therefore, fouling caused by 0.3 million Dal-
tons HPAM on heterogeneous CEMs resembles that on AEMs because
small MWs HPAM cause membrane pore blockage, which inuence
ion transition in membrane seriously. Additionally, homogeneous
membranes are thinner than heterogeneous membranes and pore
sizes are smaller, so their membrane pore blockage are not serious as
heterogeneous membranes. Thus, fouling of heterogeneous IEMs
being more serious than homogeneous IEMs may be due to physical
blockage.
Polluted CEMs were soaked in HCl solution (0.1 M) for 24 h and
cleaned to study the effects of MWs of HPAM on IEMs. It is manifest
from Fig. 10 that HPAM with lower MWs were more likely to foul the

heterogeneous CEMs, which also further indicated that the fouling of
heterogeneous CEMs was because of the blockage of membrane pores.
To verify experimental results above, polluted heterogeneous IEMs
employed in Daqing desalination system were soaked in 0.1 M HCl
cleaning solution for 24 h and cleaned. MW distribution of HPAM in
the cleaning solution was measured and fouling characteristic of IEMs
polluted by HPAM with different MWs was analyzed. Results are
shown in Fig. 11.
MW of HPAM below 0.01 million Daltons had higher proportion in
cleaning solution of CEMs than that of AEMs and results were exactly
the opposite when it comes to HPAM with MWs above 0.01 million Dal-
tons. It was clear that HPAM with lower MWs tended to foul the CEMs
and HPAM with higher MWs tended to foul the AEMs.
Therefore, lower HPAM MW was easier to foul heterogeneous CEMs.
It indicated that the severe fouling of heterogeneous CEMs was caused
by the blockage of membrane pores.

4. Conclusions

In this study, desalination performance of IEMs treating polymer
ooding wastewater and inuence of HPAM MWs on membrane foul-
ing were investigated. HPAM affected the desalination performance
and energy consumption more signicantly compared to oil. It was ver-
ied that the transmembrane potential of the AEMs and the membrane
resistance increased with the rise of HPAM MWs, thus causing the AEM
fouling. However, the fouling extent of the CEM was much slighter and
the CEM fouling increased with the decrease of HPAM MWs. Results of
MWDs of polymers in cleaning solutions also indicated that CEMs had
a tendency to be fouled by HPAM with lower MWs and AEMs were eas-
ier to be fouled by HPAM with higher MWs. Moreover, the desalination
effect of homogeneous AEMs with higher average charge density was
better than heterogeneous AEMs, suggesting that membranes with
higher xed charge density could possibly enhance the limiting current
density and ion transference number. Furthermore, electrostatic inter-
action, interface thermodynamic interaction and MWs all affected
membrane fouling. Electrostatic interactions, especially for AEMs, inu-
enced membrane fouling the most remarkably.
