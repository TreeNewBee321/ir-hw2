abstract

In this paper the performances of two state-of-the-art Interpolated Discrete Fourier Transform (IpDFT) 
algorithms are analyzed when sine-wave frequency must be estimated over short observation intervals. 
The rst estimator, called enhanced IpDFT (e-IpDFT) algorithm, exploits a two-point interpolation and 
compensates the detrimental contribution of the fundamental image component on the estimated fre- 
quency by using an iterative procedure. The second estimator, called IpDFT-EIF algorithm, eliminates that 
contribution by using a three-point interpolation. Both algorithms reduce the spectral leakage due to 
time-domain truncation by weighting the acquired signal by a Maximum Sidelobe Decay (MSD) window. 
The analysis is performed in the case of ideal, noisy, and noisy and harmonically distorted sine-waves. 
Theoretical expressions for the estimation Mean Square Errors (MSEs) due to noise and harmonics are 
derived and veried through simulations and experiments. The performed analysis allows the selection 
of the best frequency estimator for given signal-to-noise-ratio, harmonic content, and number of acquired 
cycles.

1. Introduction 

Sine-waves are used in many applications such as commu- 
nications, instrumentation, power systems, sonar, and vibration 
analysis. Either time-domain and frequency-domain approaches 
have been proposed for accurate measurement of their parame- 
ters [1] . Since frequency-domain methods exhibit both good ac- 
curacy and low computational burden, they are often preferred to 
time-domain methods, especially when dealing with real-time ap- 
plications. One of the most widely adopted frequency-domain ap- 
proaches is the so-called Interpolated Discrete Fourier Transform 
(IpDFT) procedure. Indeed, it provides accurate estimates and it 
is simple to implement [2¨C11] . To reduce the detrimental contri- 
bution on the estimated parameters due to spectral interference 
from narrow band disturbances like harmonics or spurious tones, 
the IpDFT procedure weights the analyzed signal by a suitable win- 
dow function. Cosine class windows are often employed since they 
are simple to generate and their spectrum can be expressed in 
closed form. In particular, Maximum Sidelobe Decay (MSD) win- 
dows [6,12] are often adopted since the related IpDFT sine-wave 
parameter estimates are expressed by simple analytical relation- 
ships [2,5,6] . Moreover, they exhibit the highest sidelobe decay 
rate among all the cosine windows with a given number of terms, 
thus ensuring very good spectral leakage suppression capabilities 
[12] . Using the IpDFT procedure, at rst the sine-wave frequency 
is estimated by interpolating the two discrete spectrum samples 
with the largest magnitude [4] . Then, the sine-wave amplitude and 
phase are determined exploiting the estimated frequency value. As 
a result, frequency estimation accuracy affects any estimated pa- 
rameters. One of the main drawbacks of the IpDFT procedure is 
that a minimum number of sine-wave cycles (usually at least 3 or 
4 cycles, depending on the adopted window) needs to be analyzed. 
Indeed, if very few sine-wave cycles are observed, as occurs for in- 
stance when monitoring power grids [8] , frequency estimates are 
heavily affected by the interference from both the fundamental im- 
age component and harmonics. An enhanced two-point IpDFT al- 
gorithm that exhibits a high rejection to the spectral interference 
from the image component has been proposed in [8] . This algo- 
rithm, called e-IpDFT frequency estimator in the following, is sim- 
ilar to the one proposed in [9] , but the contribution of the funda- 
mental image component on the spectrum samples is removed by 
using an iterative procedure. It is worth noticing that the accuracy 
of the e-IpDFT frequency estimator can be improved by using a 
more accurate phase spectrum model than the one adopted in the 
literature. Therefore, a modied e-IpDFT algorithm based on such 
a model will be considered in the following. 
Another approach to achieve the same goal exploits multipoint 
frequency-domain interpolation [13¨C19] . In particular, a three- 
point IpDFT algorithm which totally Eliminates the contribution 
of the spectral Image of the Fundamental component (called in 
the following IpDFT-EIF frequency estimator) has been proposed 
in [16] and then recently extended to sine-waves affected by dc- 
offset [19] . That algorithm provides accurate sine-wave amplitude 
and phase estimates [17] , and outperforms the multi-point IpDFT 
algorithms based on nite differences of the interpolation points 
[14,15] . 
Due to their capability of suppressing the detrimental contribu- 
tion of the fundamental image component, the e-IpDFT and IpDFT- 
EIF procedures are expected to provide accurate frequency esti- 
mates when only very few signal cycles are observed. However, in 
practice the acquired signal is usually affected by harmonics and 
wideband noise. Unfortunately, to the best of the authors¡¯ knowl- 
edge, the contribution of such disturbances to the e-IpDFT and 
IpDFT-EIF frequency estimator accuracies has not been yet ana- 
lyzed in the scientic literature. To this aim analytical expressions 
for the Mean Square Errors (MSEs) of the returned frequency es- 
timators are derived in this paper and then veried through both 
simulation and experimental results. 
The performed analysis allows the determination of the min- 
imum number of sine-wave cycles required to ensure a speci- 
ed IpDFT frequency estimation accuracy. It also enables a rational 
choice of the best IpDFT frequency estimator for a given applica- 
tion. 
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2 the expressions for the MSEs of the e-IpDFT and IpDFT- 
EIF estimators due to both wideband noise and harmonics are de- 
rived. The sensitivity to harmonics and noise of the e-IpDFT and 
IpDFT-EIF frequency estimator MSEs are analyzed in Section 3 . 
The e-IpDFT and IpDFT-EIF estimator accuracies are also compared 
through both computer simulations and experimental results in 
Section 4 . Finally, Section 5 presents some conclusions.

2.2. MSE of the e-IpDFT frequency estimator 

The e-IpDFT algorithm estimates the sine-wave frequency us- 
ing a two-step procedure. In the rst step, called coarse-search, 
the spectrum peak location is determined by means of a maximum 
search procedure applied to the periodogram of the weighted sig- 
nal y w ( 
). When the frequency Signal-to-Noise Ratio is higher than 
about 17 dB the probability of correct bin selection is very high [5] . 
The second step, called ne-search, returns the inter-bin frequency 
 ¦Ä2 p . It interpolates two weighted DFT samples using the 
location 
iterative procedure proposed in [8] and described in Table 1 using 
a pseudo-code. 
In steps 3 and 7, the function sign( z ) represents the sign of its 
1 when z

argument z (i.e. it is equal to 
 0 and 1 when z

It is worth noticing that the above phase estimator is more ac- 
curate than that used in the classical IpDFT algorithm, in which the

(  ¦Ä )
approximation M/
(M

is neglected [5] .

Fig. 1 shows the above ratio for k 
 2, 3, and 4 as a function 
of the number of acquired signal cycles 
¦Í when the two-term 
( Fig. 1 (a)) and the three-term ( Fig. 1 (b)) MSD windows are used. 
The number of acquired signal cycles 
¦Í takes values in the range 
[1.51, 6) cycles with a step of 1/20. It is worth noticing that at least 
1.5 cycles are considered because leakage suppression capabilities 
¦Í , as it will 
of the IpDFT-EIF algorithm prevails for lower values of 
be shown in the next section. Observe also that a ratio smaller 
than one means that the e-IpDFT frequency estimator is less sen- 
sitive to the considered harmonic than the IpDFT-EIF estimator. 
Fig. 1 shows that both frequency estimators provide accuracies 
close to each other when the fractional frequency 
¦Ä is positive (i.e. 
in the intervals l 
 0.5, with l integer), although the IpDFT- 
EIF estimator outperforms the e-IpDFT estimator. Conversely, when 
¦Ä is negative, the IpDFT-EIF frequency estimator is highly sensitive 
to harmonics, especially to the 2nd and the 3rd order ones. More- 
over, the ratio c 2 p , h 
( k ) decreases as H increases. 
Fig. 2 shows the squares of the maximum contributions to the 
(k 
)
(k 
)
estimated frequency due to the k th harmonic 
 and 
k 
 2 and 3, when assuming A k 
, as a function of the number 
¦Í . The two-term ( Fig. 2 (a)) and the three-term 
of observed cycles 
( Fig. 2 (b)) MSD windows are used. 
As it can be seen, when the sine-wave is affected by a 2nd har- 
monic the e-IpDFT estimator outperforms the IpDFT-EIF estimator 
when 
 1 cycles, except when 2 
 2.5 cycles for H 
 2, and 
when 2 
 2.5 cycles or 3 
 3.5 cycles for H 
 3, where the 
considered estimator accuracies are close to each other. For the re- 
maining values of 
¦Í , the e-IpDFT estimator provides better accu- 
0.5 
racy in the intervals l 
 0.5 
 1, l integer (i.e. 
 0), 
while the IpDFT-EIF estimator is more accurate when l 
 0.5 
(i.e. 0 
 0.5). Conversely, when considering the contribution of 
a 3rd harmonic the IpDFT-EIF and the e-IpDFT estimators have al- 
most the same accuracy for both H 
 2 and H 
 3, except when 
 H were the e-IpDFT estimator performs better. Moreover, es- 
timators errors of both algorithms are signicant when very few 
cycles are observed, especially when the signal is affected by a 2nd 
harmonic, even though errors quickly decrease as 
¦Í increases. 
When the contribution of wideband noise to the estimation er- 
ror dominates the effect of harmonics, (15) and (24) provide the 
following expression for the ratio between the sensitivities to noise 
c 2 p , n and c 3 p , n of the e-IpDFT and the IpDFT-EIF frequency estima-

decreases as H increases. Moreover, for small values of 
the maximum values of the sensitivity ratio slightly increases as 
increases, while it remains almost constant for

As it can be seen, the best accuracy is ensured by the IpDFT- 
EIF frequency estimator. When 0.5 
 1.5 cycles the e-IpDFT fre- 
quency estimator exhibits poor accuracy. Conversely, the IpDFT-EIF 
algorithm provides very accurate estimates also when observing 
less than one cycle. Indeed, when such a low number of cycles 
is observed, sine-wave amplitude and phase estimates involved in 
the e-IpDFT algorithm are quite inaccurate due to strong interfer- 
ence from the fundamental image component. The e-IpDFT and 
the IpDFT-EIF estimators provide a comparable accuracy when at 
least about 5 cycles are observed. Observe also that the MSE of 
the IpDFT-EIF estimator essentially depends only on the fractional 
part of the number of observed cycles 
¦Ä . This occurs because the 
IpDFT-EIF algorithm completely removes the effect of the funda- 
mental image component and the residual error is due only to the 
approximated relationship (5) . Conversely, the MSE of the e-IpDFT 
frequency estimator decreases as 
¦Í increases since the related im- 
age component rejection capability depends on the accuracies of 
the other estimated sine-wave parameters, which increases as the 
number of observed signal cycles increases.

conditions are the same as in Fig. 4 , except that the signal is cor- 
rupted by wideband noise. 
When 0.5 
 1.5 cycles, the IpDFT-EIF estimator returns good 
results while the e-IpDFT estimator exhibits very poor accuracy. 
That behavior is not explained by theoretical results. Indeed, as 
Fig. 4 shows, when considering very short intervals, the results 
returned by the e-IpDFT algorithm are strongly affected by the 
residual contribution of the image component. Conversely, when 
 1.5 cycles and SNR 
 30 dB or 
 2 cycles and SNR

both estimators exhibit a very good agreement between theoret- 
ical and simulation results. That behavior occurs because the con-

tribution due to wideband noise largely prevails over the effect 
of the fundamental image component. In these situations, as ex- 
pected from theory, the e-IpDFT algorithm outperforms the IpDFT- 
EIF algorithm, except in quasi-coherent sampling conditions. Also, 
it can be seen that when 
 1.5 cycles the maxima of MSE [  
0.5. More- 
are reached for 
 0, while those of MSE [  
over, it can observed that the MSEs of all the considered frequency 
estimators are greater than the CRLB due to windowing [6,15] . 
Fig. 6 shows the MSEs of the considered frequency estima- 
tors returned by theory ( eqs. (15) and (24) ) and simulations as a 
function of SNR when 
 1.6 cycles ( Fig. 6 (a)) and 
 2.3 cycles 
( Fig. 6 (b)). The related CRLBs for unbiased estimators are also re- 
ported for comparison. The SNR was varied in the range [0, 100] 
dB with a step of 5 dB. 
As it can be observed the IpDFT-EIF frequency estimator does 
not suffer from the interference due to the fundamental image

 2.3 cycles the above detrimental 
effect is negligible in the whole range of considered SNR values. 
Moreover, the MSEs of both frequency estimators are close to each 
other. 

4.1.3. Noisy and harmonically distorted sine-waves 
Fig. 7 shows the MSEs of the considered frequency estimators 
returned by both theory ( eqs. (16) and (25) ) and simulations ver- 
¦Í when considering a noisy and 
sus the number of acquired cycles 
harmonically distorted sine-wave. The SNR equal to 60 dB, while 
the Total Harmonic Distortion ( THD ), equal to 5%, is due to the 
2nd, 3rd, and 4th harmonics with amplitudes in the ratios 4:2:1 
( Fig. 7 (a)) or 2:4:1 ( Fig. 7 (b)), respectively. The simulation condi- 
tions are the same as in Fig. 4 , except that the signal is corrupted 
by both wideband noise and harmonics. The related single tone 
CRLB for unbiased estimators is also shown in Fig. 7 . 
In the considered examples the contribution of harmonics gen- 
erally prevails over those due to the fundamental image compo- 
nent and wideband noise since their effect on the estimated fre- 
quency is not effectively rejected by the algorithms. As expected,

Fig. 7 shows that the IpDFT-EIF algorithm outperforms the e-IpDFT 
algorithm when 0.5 
 1.5 cycles. Also, the IpDFT-EIF algorithm 
MSEs returned by theory and simulations are very close to each 
¦Í , while theory explains the e- 
other for all considered values of 
IpDFT algorithm MSEs only when 
 1.5 cycles. When the 2nd 
harmonic prevails ( Fig. 7 (a)), the same behavior as in Fig. 2 (a) 
is achieved. Thus, the e-IpDFT frequency estimator outperforms 
the IpDFT-EIF one for 
 3 cycles, except when 2 
 2.5 cycles, 
where both estimators exhibit almost the same accuracy. When 
3 
 6 cycles the e-IpDFT estimator provides better accuracy in 
the intervals l 
 0.5 
 1, l integer, while the IpDFT-EIF esti- 
mator is more accurate when l 
 0.5. It is worth noticing 
that due to the smaller contribution of the 3rd and 4th harmon- 
ics behaviors very similar to those reported in Fig. 7 (a) are ob- 
tained when the signal THD is due only a 2nd harmonic of am- 
plitude 0.05. The MSE behavior reported in Fig. 7 (b) is the same as 
in Fig. 7 (a), even though the third harmonic overcomes the second 
one. Indeed, the 2nd harmonic contribution dominates due to its 
closeness to the fundamental component. 
Many other simulations have been performed for different THD 
values. MSE behaviors very similar to those reported in Fig. 7 have 
been observed as long as the harmonic contribution overcomes the 
effect of wideband noise. Conversely, when wideband noise pre- 
vails, behaviors like those reported in Fig. 5 have been obtained.

amplitude was set to 2 V and the frequencies were varied in the 
range [300, 580] Hz with a step of 20 Hz. Since records of M 
 512 
samples were acquired, the number of analyzed sine-wave cycles 
varied in the range (1.5, 3.0) cycles. For each frequency value 10 0 0 
subsequent runs were analyzed with initial phases varying at ran- 
dom. Three kinds of test signals were considered. The rst test 
signal was a sine-wave with a SIgnal-to-Noise And Distortion ra- 
tio SINAD of about 52 dB. Noisy and harmonically distorted sine- 
waves were then obtained by adding to that sine-wave a 2nd, 
3rd, and 4th harmonics with amplitudes in the ratios of about

4:2:1 or 2:4:1 and chosen in such a way that the signal THD was 
about 5%. In the case of noisy sine-waves, frequency, and SINAD 
parameters were estimated by means of the four-parameter sine- 
t (4PSF) algorithm [26] . When considering noisy and harmonically 
distorted sine-waves the multi-harmonic sine-t (MHSF) algorithm 
was used to estimate frequency, fundamental component and har- 
monic phases, SINAD , and THD parameters [27] . Six iterations were 
performed in both sine-t algorithms. They were adopted since 
they provide the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) when the 
input signal is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise, so en- 
suring estimator variances very close to the CRLB [28] .

was evaluated by considering the standard deviations of these es- 
timates. 
Fig. 8 shows that the e-IpDFT frequency estimator outper- 
¦Í is close to 1.5 cycles and 
forms the IpDFT-EIF algorithm when 
2 
 2.7 cycles. For the remaining values of 
¦Í , the IpDFT-EIF 
frequency estimator outperforms the e-IpDFT frequency estimator. 
That behavior almost agrees with simulation results reported in 
Fig. 5 . Also, the variances of both analyzed frequency estimators 
are greater than the related CRLB, mainly due to windowing. 
Fig. 9 shows the standard deviations of the frequency estimates 
returned by the considered algorithms and the estimated square

root of the CRLB as a function of 
monically distorted sine-waves. The value of 
¦Í was determined as 
the sample mean of 10 0 0 estimates returned by the MHSF algo- 
rithm and the square root of the CRLB was evaluated by consider- 
ing the standard deviations of these estimates. 
Fig. 9 shows that the e-IpDFT frequency estimator outper- 
forms the IpDFT-EIF algorithm in most considered situations, ex- 
cept when 2 
 2.5 cycles, where the latter estimator performs 
slightly better. Also, the standard deviations reported in Fig. 9 (b) 
are smaller than those in Fig. 9 (a) due to the smaller amplitude 
of the 2nd harmonic of the test signal. Moreover, as expected, the 
variances of both the e-IpDFT and the IpDFT-EIF frequency estima- 
tors are higher than the related CRLB even in this case. Observe 
also that the above results are very similar to those returned by 
simulations and reported in Fig. 7 .

4.3. Processing times 

The processing times required by the considered frequency es- 
timators when implemented in Matlab 7.1 environment were com- 
pared to each other. The DFT was implemented using the dening 
formula (direct implementation) and the location of the DFT spec- 
trum peak was assumed a priori known. The programs were run- 
ning on a portable computer provided with a 2.6 GHz processor, 4 
GB RAM memory, equipped with a Microsoft Windows 8.1 operat- 
ing system. The average processing times required to obtain 10,0 0 0 
frequency estimates were 0.27 ms or 0.25 ms when using the e- 
IpDFT algorithm implemented with two iterations or the IpDFT-EIF 
algorithm, respectively. Thus, the analyzed frequency estimators re- 
quire comparable processing effort s.

This paper analyzes the accuracies of the e-IpDFT [8] and the 
IpDFT-EIF [16] frequency estimators through theoretical, simula- 
tion, and experimental results in the case when few signal cy- 
cles of ideal, noisy, and noisy and harmonically distorted sine- 
waves are acquired. Novel analytical expressions for the contri- 
bution of both harmonics and wideband noise to the estimator 
MSEs have been derived. It has been shown that when 0.5 
 1.5 
signal cycles are observed, the IpDFT-EIF estimator provides a 
much better accuracy than the e-IpDFT estimator. For 
 1.5 cy- 
cles, when the effect of harmonics prevails over the fundamen- 
tal image component and wideband noise, the e-IpDFT estimator 
outperforms the IpDFT-EIF one almost everywhere in the range 
1.5 
 3 cycles when the fractional part of the observed signal 
cycles is negative, while the IpDFT-EIF provides slightly better ac- 
curacy in the remaining situations. Thus, even though the IpDFT- 
EIF algorithm eliminates the contribution of the fundamental im- 
age component it does not consistently outperform the e-IpDFT al- 
gorithm, mainly because the higher number of points used in the 
frequency-domain interpolation. When the contribution of wide- 
band noise overcomes the effects of the fundamental image com- 
ponent and harmonics, the e-IpDFT frequency estimator outper- 
forms the IpDFT-EIF algorithm, except in quasi-coherent sampling 
conditions, where the IpDFT-EIF estimator provides better accuracy. 
It has also been shown that the processing times of both the e- 
IpDFT algorithm implemented with two iterations and the IpDFT- 
EIF frequency estimator are very close to each other. The obtained 
theoretical results have been conrmed through simulation and 
experimental results. 
The MSE expressions derived in this work allow the selection of 
the best sine-wave frequency estimator among the e-IpDFT and the 
IpDFT-EIF algorithms when signal-to-noise-ratio, harmonic content 
and number of acquired signal cycles are given or can be esti- 
mated.

It is worth noticing that the correlation coecient ( A.16 ) is neg- 
ative since the real-part of E w ( 
has alternating 
signs at adjacent frequency bins.
