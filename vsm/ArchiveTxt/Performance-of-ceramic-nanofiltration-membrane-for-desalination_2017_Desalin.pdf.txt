abstract
Removing mixture salts from dye solutions using membrane technology still need to be improved for high dye
rejection and low salt rejection. In this work, ceramic membrane with pore size of 1.5 nm presented a satisfactory
desalination of dye solutions containing NaCl and Na2SO4 compared with two commercial organic nanoltration
membrane elements (DK and DL). Effect of salt content, salt type, molar ratio of NaCl and Na2SO4, dye concentra-
tion and pH on performance of ceramic membrane for desalination of Eriochrome black T (EBT) were investigat-
ed. The results showed that dye rejection decreased by increasing salt content, dye concentration and solution
pH. Compared with dye-NaCl solutions, a relative high ux and low rejection of dye were observed when treating
dye-Na2SO4 solutions. For the mixture salt-dye solutions, the ux, which was higher than that for the single salt-
dye solutions, rst increased then decreased with decreasing CNaCl/CNa2SO4 due to the change of structure of cake
layer. Supper-molecule aggregates of EBT formed by hydrogen-bond is mainly responsible for the high rejection
of EBT (N 99%) at acid conditions. The rejection of NaCl and Na2SO4 was below 20% and 40%, respectively. These
promising results demonstrates that the new ceramic membrane has a potential application in dye purication.

1. Introduction
Most dyes are produced by chemical synthesis which also produces
byproduct salts (typical NaCl and Na2SO4) as impurities [1] due to salt-
generation reactions, solution neutralization by acid/base or salt addi-
tion for promoting a chemical reaction [2,3]. To obtain the dye as a
solid, it is common to add electrolyte (usually NaCl) to the dye solution
in order to precipitate the dye, known as the salting-out process. How-
ever, the purity of the dye product is low and could contain salt as high
as 30% [1,4]. This results in a product of much lower colour intensity rel-
ative to pure dye and varying dyeing characteristics [5].
Nanoltration (NF) based process are widely used for dye desalting
and purication as alternative separation techniques to the convention-
al salting-out processes [6]. Most of the commercially available NF
membranes are made of polymeric materials and have high retention
of multivalent anions (e.g. sulfate) and organic molecules with molecu-
lar weights above 300 g/mol, and low retentions to most monovalent
anions (e.g. chloride) [3,7], which are suitable for purication and con-
centration of dye products containing monovalent salts. For example,
commercial DK (Osmonics) NF membrane was used for desalination
and purication of reactive black 5 and 96.0% rejection of dye and
21.1% retention for salt (NaCl) were observed [8], but with high rejec-
tion of Na2SO4 (N 98%) [9].
With the development of ceramic membrane, more ceramic NF
membranes are commercially available [10]. Several researches were
focused on dye wastewater treatment and separation of dye and salt
using ceramic NF and ultraltration (UF) membranes [11,12]. Ceramic
membranes are made of a mixture of diverse mineral oxide (Al2O3,
ZrO2, TiO2 and SiO2), and compared with polymeric membranes, they
are characterized with the high thermal, chemical and mechanical resis-
tance, outstanding separation characteristics and higher lifespan [13,
14]. More important, ceramic NF and UF membranes showed low rejec-
tion of NaCl and Na2SO4 [15®C17], showing great promises for

molecular weight were used in this study as shown in Table 1. ¶Àmax of
dye was obtained with dye concentration in the range of Beer's law.
NaCl of analytical grade was provided by Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd.
(PRC). Na2SO4 of analytical grade was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (PRC). All the chemicals were used without further
purication.
The feed solutions were prepared before each experiment by dis-
solving the corresponding solutes in pure water (conductivity under
5 ¶ÃS°§cm 1) until the desired concentration were reached. Sodium hy-
droxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were used to adjust the
pH of dye solutions.

2.2. Membranes

In this study, one multi-channel tubular ceramic membrane (length
of 0.5 m, external diameter of 30 mm and 19 channels of 4.0 mm inner
diameter) with pore size of 1.5 nm provided by Jiangsu Jiuwu High-tech
Co. Ltd. (PRC) was used. The material of active layer and support of the
membrane were TiO2 and ¶¡-Al2O3 respectively. The effective ltration
area of membranes was 0.1 m2. Two commercial organic spiral-
wound membrane elements (DK1812 and DL1812, membrane area of
0.38 m2) were also used.
Water permeability of each membrane was measured at 25 °„C using
pure water at a cross-ow velocity of 3 m/s before each experiment. The
initial ux (Jw) of membranes were measured at different operating
pressures (¶§P of 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 MPa for ceramic membrane,
¶§P of 0.40, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 MPa for DK and DL membranes). The pure
water permeability was determined by Darcy's law [12] as follows:
Jw  Lp  ¶§P  ¶§P= ¶Ã  Rm

where ¶Ã is the water viscosity. The slope of the straight line Jw against ¶§P
gives the pure water permeability coefcient (Lp). The Lp of the ve
membranes were used to calculate the intrinsic membrane resistance
(Rm) according to Eq. (1). The permeability coefcient of the mem-
branes were 63, 5.1, and 6.9 L°§m 2°§h 1°§bar 1 for ceramic membrane
used in this study, DK and DL membranes, respectively.

desalination of dye. Majewska-Nowak et al. [18,19] studied the perfor-
mance of three single-channel ceramic membranes (MWCO of 1 kDa,
15 kDa, and 50 kDa) for nine anionic organic dyes with molecular
weights ranging from 327 to 1060 Da with or without salts. The results
indicated that all the membranes provides 95®C 99% retention of high-
molecular-weight organic dyes (N 700 Da) without salt, while the mem-
branes with MWCO of 15 kDa and 150 kDa showed a high rejection of
Direct Black DB (N 95%) with the presence of 10 g°§L 1 NaCl. Da et al.
[11] prepared a tubular ceramic NF membrane with molecular weight
cut-off of 800 Da for separation of uorescent brightener and NaCl and
the uorescent brightener recovery of 99% was obtained while the
NaCl removal was N 98% at a temperature of 60 °„C.
Membrane performance was signicantly affected by the dye-salt-
membrane interaction in the membrane application for separation of
dye and salt [12]. Several phenomenon including charge screening
[20], change of aggregation state of dye [21,22], salting-out [23,24]
and interaction between dye molecules and membrane [12] were re-
ported in dye-salt-membrane system which inuence the ux of mem-
brane and rejection of solutes.
In this study, a tubular ceramic NF membrane was compared with
two commercial spiral-wound organic NF membrane elements (DK
and DL) for rejection of salts and six dyes with different molecular
weight and charge. The effect of different solution environment (salt
type, salt content, dye concentration, and pH) on the dye state and per-
formance of ceramic membrane were discussed. The dye-salt-mem-
brane interactions were discussed and their effect on membrane
performance was investigated.

2.3. Filtration setup and experimental procedure

All experiments with ceramic and polymeric NF membranes were
conducted with cross-ow membrane ltration system. The ltration
set-up of tubular ceramic membrane was described in our previous
work [25], and the experiment set-up for spiral-wound membrane
(DK and DL) were as shown in Fig. 1.

All experiments were performed at constant temperature of 25 °„C
with recirculation mode. Both permeate and concentrate streams
were recycled back to the feed tank except the sampled solution during
the experiments. The cross-ow velocity of 3 m°§s 1 and transmem-
brane pressure (TMP) of 0.3 MPa were xed for experiments of ceramic
membrane, and for experiments of DK and DL membranes, the TMP of
0.30 MPa and ow rate of 6.5 L°§min 1 were used. The duration of all
the experiments was 60 min.
After each ltration experiment, a cleaning procedure for ceramic
membrane was performed in order to recover the performance of the
membrane. Firstly, the membrane was rinsed with pure water for

10 min with a crossow velocity of 3 m°§s 1, temperature of 25 °„C and
atmospheric pressure in order to remove the reversible foulants. Sec-
ondly, pure water ux measurements were performed in order to
check the fouled membrane permeability. Subsequently, a chemical
cleaning was performed. The rst step was a basic cleaning with a
NaOH solution (pH = 10®C11) for 10 min at room temperature with a
CFV of 3 m°§s 1 and TMP of 0.5 bar. It was followed by a rinse with
pure water until pH 7 was achieved. The membrane was subsequently
rinsed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution (0.5 (v/v) %) at room tem-
perature for 20®C60 min based on the degree of fouling and nally it was
rinsed again with pure water until pH 7 was obtained. After the above
cleaning procedure, the membrane permeability was reevaluated to de-
termine the initial permeability recovery. For DK and DL membranes,
after each experiment, the membranes were rinsed with pure water
for 30 min at a ow rate of 6.5 L°§min1, temperature of 25 °„C, and atmo-
spheric pressure to remove the foulants, then the pure water ux was
tested. If the membrane permeability was not recovered, a basic
cleaning solution with pH of 10®C 11 was used to rinse the membrane
for 20 min and then the membranes were rinsed with pure water
until pH of 7. The membrane permeability was then reevaluated.

2.4. Analytical methods

The permeate ux was calculated by Eq. (2) as follow:

where Jp is the permeate ux (L°§m 2°§h 1), V is the volume of permeate
(L), A is the effective area of the membrane (m2), and t is the permeate
collection time (h).
The rejection of dye, NaCl and Na2SO4, R, is dened by Eq. (3):

where Cp is the concentration of the permeate and Cf is the concentra-
tion of the retentate.
Orion AquaMate 7000 VIS Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientic)
was used for the measurement of the dye concentration of permeate
and retentate at the maximum absorbance wavelength. Before testing
the dye samples, the samples were diluted and checked the ¶Àmax. The
concentration of NaCl and Na2SO4 was measured with ion chromatogra-
phy (ICS-2000, Dionex, USA). pH of feed solution was measured using
automatic potentiometric titrator (ZDJ-4A, Rex Electric Chemical,
China).

3.1. Membrane performance for different pure dyes and salts

The membranes (DK, DL and ceramic NF membrane) were evaluated
using different pure dye and salt solutions. As shown in Fig. 2, six dyes
with different molecular weights (from 300 to 1800 Da) and charge
were used in this study. It is evident from Fig. 2 (a) that the ceramic
membrane showed a high ux compared with organic NF membranes
(DK and DL). The properties of polymeric nanoltration membranes

lie between those of non-porous RO membranes (where transport is
governed by a solution-diffusion mechanism) and porous ultraltration
(UF) membranes (where separation is usually assumed to be due to size
exclusion and,
in some cases, charge effects) [27]. For ceramic
nanoltration membranes, size exclusion and charge effects were the
main separation mechanism and there was not the process of solu-
tion-diffusion compared with polymeric nanoltration membranes. So
the ux of ceramic nanoltration membranes was higher than polymer-
ic nanoltration membranes. Compared with the ceramic membrane,
DK and DL membranes are more negatively charged. When treating

DK and DL membranes. The ux of DK and DL membranes decreased
by 63.6% and 63.7% for dye MB respectively, and 17.5% and 28.1% for
GB4, respectively. For ceramic membrane, the ux decline was 16.6%
and 19.7% for dye MB and GB4, respectively.
Considering the rejection of dyes and salts, Fig. 2 (b) shows that DK
and DL membrane had a high rejection for all dyes studied (100% for
anion dyes, N 97% for cation dyes), while the ceramic membrane reject
N 96.8% anion dyes studied but b 20% of cation dyes (MB and GB4). For
rejection of salts, DK and DL membranes showed a N 60% rejection of
NaCl and N 98% rejection of Na2SO4, compared to 7% and 39% of the ce-
ramic membrane. The results show that the commercial NF DK and DL
membranes were suitable for removing NaCl form anion dye solutions
due to the severe membrane fouling when desalination of cation dyes
and high rejection of Na2SO4. On the other hand, the ceramic membrane
showed a promising application in removing both NaCl and Na2SO4 in a
single membrane separation step for dye solutions and a high ux com-
pared with DK and DL membranes.

anion dyes (EBT, RB-KNR, RB5, and RHE7B), Fig. 2 (a) showed that ux
of DK and DL membranes were close to the pure water ux, indicating a

for dye/salt mixtures. At all cases, the ux and dye rejection were lower
than that of the pure dye solutions (Fig. 2), and rejection of NaCl and

the salt in dye solutions, the shield of membrane charge and the more
dispersion of dye [12] would make dye molecule aggregate on

membrane surface easier and enter membrane pores and block the
membrane pores, resulting in the decline of ux and dye rejection. Com-
pared with the ux of pure dye solutions (Fig. 2(a)), the ux of dye-salt
mixtures decreased by 13%, 5%, 2% and 7% for EBT, RB-KNR, RB5, and
RHE7B, respectively (Fig. 3 (a)). Fig. 3 (b) shows that the rejection of
EBT remained above 99% with presence of salt although a slight decline
was observed (from 99.9% to 99.3%). On the other hand, the presence of
salts has a signicant effect on rejection of RB-KNR, RB5 and RHE7B
where the rejection decreased from 97.1% to 68.7% for RB-KNR, 96.8%
to 57.6% for RB5, and 99.5% to 76.4% for RHE7B (Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)).
This phenomenon was also observed by E. Alventosa-deLara, et al. [12]
who studied membrane performance of ultraltration ceramic mem-
brane for treatment of model dye wastewater containing dye RB5 and
salt NaCl. Due to the high rejection of EBT and low rejection of NaCl
and Na2SO4 of ceramic membrane, the dye EBT was further studied in
the following sections.

3.3. Effect of salt concentration and types on performance of ceramic
membrane

To study the effect of salt content on performance of ceramic mem-
brane, inorganic salt NaCl and Na2SO4 were used in this experiment. The
inuence of NaCl, Na2SO4 and the mixture of NaCl and Na2SO4 (molar
ratio of 1) on permeate ux and rejection of dye and salt were investi-
gated respectively with a xed EBT concentration of 500 mg°§L 1 as
shown in Fig. 4. It was evident from Fig. 4 (a) and (d) that the presence
of salts in the dye solution signicantly aggravated the membrane per-
formance that both permeate ux and dye rejection decreased with in-
creasing salt content. For the same dye-salt solution, the ux, dye and
salt rejection all decreased with increasing salt content. Comparing dif-
ferent dye-salt solutions indicates that the dye solutions with mixture
salt of NaCl and Na2SO4 have the highest ux, followed by dye solutions
with Na2SO4 and dye solutions with NaCl.
The dye rejection decreased with increasing ionic strength as shown
in Fig. 4 (d). This is because the higher ionic strength would shield the
free charge of membrane, resulting in more dye molecules passing
through the membrane thus decreasing the dye rejection [32]. Also,
the salt ions would couple with the charged dye molecules, dispersing
them more uniformly [21]. Thus, the dye particles may pass through
the membrane easily, decreasing its dye rejection. Apart from that, the
salt rejection decreased with increasing salt content due to the in-
creased concentration gradient across the membrane. The rejection of
NaCl and Na2SO4 was below 20% and 40%, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 4 (a), ux decreased with increasing ionic strength
for the same dye-salt mixtures system. For different dye-salt mixtures,
the ionic strength sequence was INaCl b I(mixture of NaCl and
Na2SO4) b INa2SO4 with the same total salt molar concentration and the
ux increased rst then decreased with increasing ionic strength.
Alventosa-delara et al. [12] reported that the charge screening of mem-
brane and more dispersion of dye molecules in presence of salt resulted
in higher adsorption of dye particles into the membrane pore walls duo
to the greater passage of dye particles through membrane, leading to
the decrease in the effective pore size and therefore reduced ux.
Wang et al. [21] noted that any concentration polarization and mem-
brane fouling would be reduced due to the increase of dye dispersion
in the presence of salt and an increase of ux with increasing feed salt
was observed when treating mixtures of congo red and NaCl. Apparent-
ly, the ux change caused by ionic strength when comparing different
dye-salt mixtures was not consistent with results reported by
Alventosa-delara et al. [12] and Wang et al. [21]. Besides, considering
the low molecule weight of EBT in relation to the MWCO of the mem-
brane and the high rejection of dye (N 99%), aggregation of dye and salt-
ing-out phenomenon may be responsible for the change of ux and high
rejection of dye.
The phenomena that the ionic organic dye molecules tend to aggre-
gate in aqueous solution has been long known [33,34]. This behavior are

generally interpreted as being due to the formation of dimers and
higher order aggregates [35], being attributed to van der Waals forces,
ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions, and dispersion forces arising
from delocalized ¶– electrons [36]. The main factors inuencing the
strength of the dye molecular aggregation was the dye concentration
and structure, temperature, solvent and electrolyte concentration [37,
38]. The aggregation of ionic dyes in aqueous solution can be enhanced
by decreasing temperature, increasing dye concentration, or adding in-
organic salts or certain substrates to the dye solution [39,40], which re-
sults in a more serious fouling and therefore the ux was decreased.
Besides, the dye would even dissolve out from the solution when salt
concentration is high, which is called salting-out phenomenon and it
is signicantly affected by salt type, salt concentration and dye concen-
tration [23,24]. And enhancement of dye aggregation and salting-out
phenomenon due to presence of high concentration of inorganic salt
was attributed to decrease of dye particles zeta potential as shown in
Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, with increasing concentration of salt, the
zeta potential of dye particles decreased. And the decreased zeta poten-
tial of dye particles would make dye particles easier to approach and ag-
gregate. This is also the main reason for the salting-out phenomenon.
As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the EBT molecules form supper-molecular ag-
gregates in aqueous due to the hydrogen-bond between molecules and
this phenomenon is enhanced when pH b 6.3 [41]. For different salt ion,
Voet [42] reported that the inuence of cation and anions on aggrega-
tions was attributed to the effect of salt on hydrophobic interactions,
and put forward lyotropic numbers for different ions (T values for cat-
ions and N values for anions). Relatively large T values and small N
values correspond to a large hydrophobic effect and favour dye

aggregation. The results showed that SO4
2 (N = 2) is more effective on
dye aggregation than Cl (N = 10).
The pH of feed solutions in these experiments was in the range of 4®C
5. As shown in Fig. 5 (b), the EBT molecules in aqueous solution with pH
of 4®C5 aggregated severely to form dye particles. This was the reason to
why the membrane showed a high rejection of EBT (shown in Fig. 5
(d)). When salt was present in EBT solutions, due to the salting-out ef-
fect, the solubility of dye particles decreased to form bigger particles and
may even precipitate out from the solutions as shown in Fig. 5 (c), main-
taining the high rejection of dye. With increasing NaCl content, more
dye particles were precipitated on the bottom of sampling tube after
standing for 48 h. But the dye molecules and small dye particles in aque-
ous could pass through the membrane easily, and due to the enhance-
ment of charge screening of membrane with increasing ionic strength,
the dye rejection was decreased slightly.
As shown in Fig. 4 (b), the different ionic environment in dye solu-
tions resulted in the different dye particles size distribution. This phe-
nomenon may be responsible for the change of ux of different salt-
dye solutions because the dye particles size distribution affects the
structure of cake layer directly which was related to the ux. As present-
ed in Fig. 4 (c), many studies [28,30,31] have reported that ux in-
creased with increase in particle size for monodispersed suspensions
due to the higher porosity of cake layer formed by the larger particles.
The deposit layer on the membrane surface consisting of spheres of
varying size will normally have a smaller porosity than one consisting
of spheres of a single size [29]. Fig. 4 (b) shows the dye particles size dis-
tribution of three dye-salt solutions with the same total molar concen-
tration of salt. It was clear that the dye solution with 0.085 mol°§L 1

membrane.

NaCl (with the lowest ionic strength) showed a multimodal distribution
of dye particles. With increasing ionic strength (INaCl b Imix b INa2SO4),
dye particles size distribution tend to show a bimodal distribution rath-
er than a multimodal distribution. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the multimod-
al distribution of dye particles (dye solution with 0.085 mol°§L 1 NaCl)
resulted in the lowest ux. Compared with the dye particles size distri-
bution of dye solution with presence of 0.085 mol°§L 1 mixture salt, the
0.085 mol°§L 1 Na2SO4 (with the highest ionic strength) caused the dye
particles to be smaller, forming more compact cake layer and resulting
in a relative low ux.

3.4. Effect of CNaCl/CNa2SO4 on performance of ceramic membrane

Effect of the molar concentration rate of NaCl and Na2SO4 (CNaCl/
CNa2SO4) on permeate ux and rejection of dye and salt with total
molar concentration of 0.085 mol°§L 1 of salt was investigated as
shown in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7 (a), it was clearly shown that the ratio of
CNaCl and CNa2SO4 had a signicant effect on ux. When CNaCl/CNa2SO4
was above 1, ux increased with increasing concentration of Na2SO4,
but when CNaCl/CNa2SO4 was below 1, increasing concentration of
Na2SO4 aggravated the ux. This phenomenon may be attributed to
the change of the size distribution of dye particles with different ionic
environment as shown Fig. 7 (b), which directly affected the structure
of the cake layer. In dye solution with mixture of NaCl and Na2SO4,
dye particles size distribution changed from a multimodal distribution
to a bimodal distribution with decreasing CNaCl/CNa2SO4 when CNaCl/
CNa2SO4 was above 1, resulting in the ux improvement. When CNaCl/
CNa2SO4 was below 1, the apparent bimodal distribution of dye particles
was observed and with decreasing CNaCl/CNa2SO4, the dye particles be-
came smaller, and the amount of small dye particles increased which
decrease the ux. These results were consist with the results of Chang
et al. [29] and Fred et al. [43] (More particles with different size and
smaller particles size in suspension result in lower ux). Considering
the membrane separation performance, the dye rejection had a slight
decrease with decreasing CNaCl/CNa2SO4 (increasing ionic strength) due
to the charge screening effect and more dispersion of the dye molecules
[21,32]. The rejection of NaCl and Na2SO4 were below 20%, and the re-
jection of Na2SO4 was higher than that of NaCl due to steric effect.

3.5. Effect of dye concentration on performance of ceramic membrane

The effect of dye concentration on membrane performance was also
investigated as shown in Fig. 8. It was clear from Fig. 8 (a), as expected,
that the ux decreased when the dye concentration was increased. Flux
decline is known to be caused by the concentration polarization phe-
nomenon and by the deposition of particles within the membrane
pores or onto its external surface, forming a cake layer which increases
the ltration resistance [12]. The fouling layer is an additional resistive
layer to the permeate of dyes [4] and the enhanced dye aggregation
with increasing dye concentration [35,37] increased the dye rejection
(Fig. 8 (b)).
Fig. 8 (b) illustrates the rejection of dye and salts with different dye
concentration. It was clear from the Fig. 8 (b) that dye rejection had no
obvious change (all above 99.3%) with a slight increasing trend. The in-
crease of dye concentration would increase the possibility of aggrega-
tion of dye, and the aggravation of membrane fouling acted as an
additional layer prevents the dye from passing through membrane.
These may be the reason for the high rejection of dye and the increasing
trend. Fig. 8 (b) also shows that salt rejection decreased with increasing
dye concentration. This was because when charged solute (dye) was
present, the accumulation of dye molecules near membrane surface
would result in the charge screening of membrane, thus decreasing
the rejection of salt. It was previously reported that the NaCl retention
decreased greatly when charged solute (glutamic acid) was added, but
neutral solute (glucose) did not affect the NaCl retention [44].

3.6. Effect of solution pH on performance of ceramic membrane

References

In this study, the effect of pH of feed solution on membrane perfor-
mance was investigated. It is shown from Fig. 9 that the pH of the feed
solution has a signicant inuence on the membrane performance.
The ux increased (Fig. 9 (a)) and dye rejection decreased (Fig. 9 (b))
noticeably with increasing pH of feed solutions. The point where the
pH was 6 was a transitional region where ux and dye rejection
changed evidently. The change of surface charge of membrane and
dye state at different pH of feed solution may be responsible for the evo-
lution of ux and rejection.
For ceramic membrane used in these experiments, made of TiO2 and
Al2O3, the isoelectric point (IEP, where membrane surface dose not
present electrical charge) of membrane is around 6 [45]. The membrane
surface is positively charged when pH b IEP and negatively charged
when pH N IEP [12]. The dye, EBT, used in this study is shown to have
functional group with negative charge as shown in Table 1. When pH
is below 6, electrostatic attraction between dye molecules and mem-
brane surface results in the accumulation of dye on the membrane sur-
face, aggravating the membrane fouling and decreasing ux and dye
rejection. When pH is above 6, electrostatic repulsion between dye mol-
ecules and membrane surface decreases the concentration of dye on
membrane surface, alleviating membrane fouling and increasing dye re-
jection. However, the dye rejection decreased when pH was above 6
(Fig. 9 (b)), indicating that the electrostatic interaction mechanism is
not the sole reason to the change of dye rejection.
The dye rejection was above 99% when pH was below 6, and a sharp
decline (to 85%) was observed when pH increased from 6 to 10. The de-
gree of aggregation of dye molecules at different pH may be responsible
for this. In the work of Xie et al. [41], the aggregation of EBT was aggra-
vated when pH was below 6.3. When pH was above 6.3, the dye mole-
cules aggregation was weakened, resulting in smaller dye particles size.
Therefore, the dye rejection was decreased due to the passage of smaller
dye particles through membrane. The enhancement of dye dispersion
when pH was above 6.3 alleviated the concentration polarization and
membrane fouling, leading to the increase in the ux at high pH.

4. Conclusions

A ceramic nanoltration (NF) membrane with MWCO of 900 Da and
two commercial NF DK and DL membranes were used in this study for
desalination of dye solutions and ceramic NF membrane showed be
suitable for desalination of dye solutions containing NaCl and Na2SO4 si-
multaneously due to the satisfactory dye rejection and low rejection of
both NaCl and Na2SO4. The effect of salt content and type, CNaCl/
CNa2SO4, dye concentration, and pH of solution on performance of ce-
ramic NF for desalination of dye EBT was studied. The aggregation of
dye EBT in aqueous was affected by solution environment (ionic type
and concentration, dye concentration and pH) and dye solution showed
different particle size distribution. The results revealed that rejection of
dye EBT was dominated by the steric effect due to the aggregation of dye
molecule. Flux and dye rejection was decreased with increasing salt
content, dye concentration and ux increased and dye rejection de-
creased with increasing pH of solution. The dye solution with mixture
of NaCl and Na2SO4 showed a higher ux than single salt. Dye rejection
was all above 99% when pH was below 6 and rejection of NaCl and
Na2SO4 were below 20% and 40%, respectively.
