 The performance of pressure vessel could be optimized with applying HID.
 The most inuenced design factor on boron rejection was feed water temperature.
 The design using high ux membranes on tail position is preferred since it doesn't exceed recovery rate limit.

abstract

Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) has been applied as a desalination method to provide potable water to regions
under the stress of water shortages and is more effective than other desalination processes. However, specic en-
ergy consumption (SEC) must be considered in SWRO process design because of its energy intensive features. Hy-
brid membrane inter-stage design (HID) was examined to enhance the SEC efciency of the reverse osmosis
process. The additional removal of boron may improve the water quality by adding a second pass. However,
this additional factor may increase costs. This study investigated a potential HID that satises water quality stan-
dards with single pass SWRO only. The element conguration for the HID was evaluated by changes in SEC, salt
rejection, and boron rejection under general seawater quality conditions. Case studies were also conducted to es-
timate the energy efciency of the HID under three feed conditions: high concentration and high temperature
(Case 1); low concentration and high temperature (Case 2); and low concentration and low temperature (Case
3). The results showed HID application can save up to 0.41 kWh/m3 of SEC. Temperature is a more important de-
sign factor than recovery rate for HID application.

1. Introduction

Reverse osmosis (RO) technology has recently dominated the desa-
lination market because it has the least expensive unit cost for the pro-
duction of water [1,2]. Despite the low unit cost, RO technology involves
a more energy intensive process for the treatment of seawater or saline
water than other conventional fresh water resources [3,4]. Accordingly,
the main purpose of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) research is the
reduction of energy consumption. Major improvements in SWRO ener-
gy efciency over the last few decades have included the development
of thin-lm composite membranes and energy recovery devices [2,5每
10]. In addition, SWRO system design improvements from a membrane
module to an RO train have further enhanced SWRO energy efciency
[11每14]. The RO module conguration in pressure vessels (PVs) has
been a focus of SWRO design research recently. It is common for the
ux of the rst element position to be relatively higher than the tail
side position elements in a SWRO PV because of the higher osmotic
pressure at the tail position element from the gradual recovery of feed
water. An internally staged design (ISD) concept was developed as a
novel RO module congurat ion in a PV by Dow Chem ica l (PCT/
US05/06224) to solve these unbalanced ux problems [15]. Two or
more membrane types were used in the same PV for the ISD , in
which higher productivity membranes were located in other posi-
tions than the rst and second position. This ISD not only enhanced
total productivity of the PV unit but also reduced the fouling poten-
tial of the front position elements. Molina et al. showed the cost sav-
ing by retrotting the conventional pressure vessel des ign to ISD
with fouling factors and feed temperature changes . However , this
study was conducted w ith 2nd pass SWRO process . It means that
there were no concerns about permeate water qua lity due to the
presence of 2nd pass [16每18].
The hybrid membrane inter-stage design (HID) uses commercial
SWRO membranes from three different manufacturers. This concept
has been used without limiting the element position and manufacturer.
Penete et al. extended the ISD concept which applies only Dow Chemi-
cal membrane elements to the HID concept, applying membrane mod-
ules in every membrane manufacturer. They showed the performance
comparison and retrotting strategy for canary island SWRO plants.
These two reports mentioned that ISD and HID can reduce total cost
and energy consumptions. [19].
The RO process must be optimized according to diverse design fac-
tors such as feed water quality, operating conditions, regional drinking
water standards, and plant management [20每26]. Boron is one of the
key design factors in the SWRO process owing to its low removal rate
compared with other ions. The average boron concentration in seawater
is 4.8 mg/L, and it exists as boric acid and borate ions in seawater [27,
28]:

 ; pKa  9:2 at pH 7 and 25 ∼C:

Bor ic ac id is a major component of the boron mo lecu lar form
w ith in a low pH range . Bor ic ac id ex ists in an uncharged form in
aqueous so lut ion; thus , hydrated boron mo lecu les are relat ive ly
lower than other ion species in seawater . Therefore , conventional
SWRO membranes remove less boron (approx imate ly 70%) than
other anions and cat ions [29] . However , the borate ion form is
completely hydrated and charged in feed solut ions in a high pH
range and causes a high rejection rate in the SWRO membrane pro-
cess ow ing to s ize exc lus ion and repu ls ion phenomena . A lthough
the Wor ld Health Organization rev ised the boron concentrat ion
l imit to 2 .4 mg/L in 2012 [30] , the European Un ion ma inta ins a
boron limit of 1.0 mg/L for potable water [31] because of the risk it
presents to crops [32每34]. Therefore, a process should be designed
that results in boron concentrations of 1 mg/L or lower to provide
seawater desalination to various countries.
High boron removal rates have been achieved mainly through the
use of add itiona l processes , ion exchange (IX) , and a second pass
with pH adjustment. These post-treatment processes incur addition-
al capital and operating costs between 0.04 $/m3 and 0 .1 $/m3 [29,
35]. Researchers have attempted to adjust boron levels with only a
single pass and no post-treatment to avoid these additional costs .
Their results indicated SWRO membrane boron removal ability was
enhanced and satised the water quality criteria using single-pass
SWRO systems with various operat ing conditions and membrane
types. The pH control was the main issue for the single-pass SWRO
system both with and without a chemical dosage because of the rela-
tionship between scaling problems and boron removal [36每39] .
However , ISD research has not yet evaluated boron removal and
has instead focused on energy efciency through the application of
high-ux membranes.
The main objective of this study is to develop novel approach of
SWRO vessel design by using the HID on the optimal single-pass de-
sign and suitable operating conditions of commercial SWRO mem-
branes to meet 1 mg B/L water with commerc ia l membrane
elements. Inter-staged technique was utilized not only to solve un-
balanced ux distribution problem, the main focus of previous HID
studies, but also to enhance the process performance. In this study,
higher ux membrane element was located not only in the front po-
sition but also in the tail position to extend HID concept for optimiz-
ing SWRO vessel des ign . Performance of H ID were evaluated by
commercial SWRO system model tool provided by the manufacturer.
Membrane congurations were evaluated by comparing three fac-
tors: permeate total dissolved solids (TDS) , boron concentration ,
and the SEC on a single-pass SWRO system. Then, three case studies
were conducted to estimate the energy efciency of the HID under
three feed condit ions: high concentration and high temperature
(Case 1) , low concentrat ion and high temperature (Case 2) , and
low concentration and low temperature (Case 3).

2. Materials and method

2.1. Pressure vessel design & operating condition

ROSA9 , the comme rc ia l s imu la t ion program by Dow Wa ter &
Process Solutions, was used to evaluate HID performance. Computa-
t iona l assessment o f membrane per fo rmance was per fo rmed on
commercial 8-inch membranes made by Dow. ROSA9 provides the
ISD analysis . Three types of RO membrane were selected based on
the ir features : h igh-re ject ion membrane (SW30XHR-400 i) , stan-
dard membrane (SW30HRLE-400 i) , and h igh-ux membrane
(SW30ULE-400 i) . The spec ica t ions o f se lec ted e lemen ts are in
Table 1.
Tab le 2 shows the membrane congurations in the simulation .
The PV composed of seven (3 + 4 element conguration) elements
to estimate the boron removal ab i l ity of a single pass . The reason
3 + 4 congurat ion was chosen is that ha lf of permeate was pro-
duced on front 3 position elements. So, permeate TDS concentration
was controlled by each of membrane types respectively on 3 + 4 (el-
ement) design. Accordingly, 3 + 4 (element) design was used in this
study. Single pass could consist of single stage or 2 stages, but there
wou ld be too many congurations of 2 stage array (e .g . 2:1; 3:2;
4:2, etc.). Recent commercial membrane performance has been rap-
idly improved, so sufcient recovery rates are obtained in the single
stage. Also, single stage was used for the simple analysis of perfor-
mance of HID.
Operating ow rate was set at 10 m3/h, and pump efciency was as-
sumed to be 80%. Optimal recovery rates of each membrane congura-
tion were calculated by comparing the SEC. Fig. 1 shows a schematic
diagram of the 7-element PV design with the conventional design and
the HID. The conventional design used one membrane type, and the
HID used two membrane types in the PV. The front position was located
in the direction of feed water inow. The tail position was located in the
direction of concentrated water emission.

2.2. Feed water quality

Feed quality in this study was separated according to two condi-
tions, general feed condition and various real feed quality data. Three
factors were used rst to obtain general information regarding the
performance of each membrane conguration PV design under gen-
eral seawater feed condition: SEC, TDS, and boron concentration of
permeate water . The analysis was conducted at a recovery rate of
45% at 20 ∼C . The feed water was assumed to ow into the SWRO
PV after the convent iona l pre-treatment process (SD I b 5) . The
ionic composition of the feed water was referred to as the ※seawater§
composition reported by M. J. Atkinson et al. [40]. The feed TDS value
was 35,000 mg salt/L; the boron concentration was 4.53 mg boron/L;
and the pH was 8.2.
Three locations where the SWRO process is mainly used were select-
ed to nd the optimal PV design. Table 3 shows the feed water quality of
the three target locations in the study (Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3). The
feed seawater has a high temperature and high TDS value in Case 1, a
low TDS and high temperature in Case 2, and a low temperature and
general feed quality in Case 3. Although these three cases cannot

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Tradeoff relation of HID PV

Many different parameters such as the ow rate of feed, TDS rejec-
tion, operational pressure, ux, and fouling potential should be consid-
ered in an SWRO process design. The RO membrane performance was
tested under standard conditions (20 ∼C, 32,000 mg/L). However, com-
mercial SWRO plant designs operated with a PV unit containing six or
more membrane elements evaluate performance not by each mem-
brane element but for the overall PV unit. Although the RO membranes
in this PV unit were developed for high permeate ux with high salt re-
jection for high efciency, their performance is generally a tradeoff be-
tween salt rejection ability and water permeability. Therefore, the PV
designs with one type of RO membrane must focus on either salt rejec-
tion or permeate ux. Conversely, both high rejection membranes and
high permeate ux membranes are used in the HID; thus, the design
range of the PV is more exible. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between
SEC and rejection of salt and boron. These data were obtained under
one PV condition without an energy recovery device (ERD) to evaluate
only the performance of the membrane conguration of a PV with an
average ux of 17.3 LMH and total active area of 260.12 m2.
Fig. 2 shows the performance and linear relationship in the PV, ex-
cept for the XHR and HID 6 congurations. The highest salt and boron
rejections are in the XHR (99.77% and 91%, respectively) conguration
and the lowest rejections are in the ULE conguration (99.31% and 78%).
The HID 6 conguration has a slightly less than linear relationship
owing to the high-ux membranes (SW30ULE-400i) in the front posi-
tion of the PV. Despite the same front conguration, HID 5 has high
SEC and rejection. Although HID 2 and HID 4 exhibit a similar relation-
ship to HID 6 and HID 5, they have lower rejection rates for salt and
boron than HID 5 and HID 6, respectively. This indicates that the module
conguration of the tail position has more of an effect on water quality
and the front membrane conguration in the PV has more of an impact
on ux. Therefore, module conguration can be designed optionally to

control water quality level or energy reduction depending on feed
water quality. The two types of module conguration in the PV in this
study were xed to three versus four to recover 50% of the total ux
by the front modules. However, if a three or more type module cong-
uration is applied, this exibility is expected to be superior.
Fig. 3 shows the design range in RO conguration under the condi-
tions of 20 ∼C, salt 35,000 ppm, and 45% recovery rate to maintain
water quality below the 1 mg/L boron concentration. Allowable boron
concentration indicates the limit of feed boron concentration when de-
signing an SWRO process for certain operating conditions. The differ-
ence of design capacity indicates the difference of allowable boron
feed concentration among the pressure vessel designs. The difference
of design capacity 1 is 2.96 B mg/L between XHR (11.05 B mg/L) and
HRLE (8.09 B mg/L). The difference of design capacity 2 is 3.47 B mg/L
between HRLE (8.09 B mg/L) and ULE (4.62 B mg/L). When we apply
the HID concept, there are 8 different design capacities in between
XHR and ULE. The difference of design capacity 1 can be composed of
3 different design capacities (XHR to HID3, HID3 to HID1 and HID1 to
HRLE). Therefore, the differences of allowable feed boron concentration
are decreased to 1.61 mg/L, 0.38 mg/L and 0.97 mg/L. As seen in Fig. 3, if
the PV is designed with only one type of RO module, it may be inefcient
and difcult to satisfy the required quality beyond its optimum feed
boron concentration range. HID can effectively redeem this narrow
the difference of design capacity by the relationship between rejection
rate and SEC. Figs. 2 and 3 show that when the HID technique is applied
to a SWRO PV design, a new HID can also be designed according to salt
and boron rejection.

3.2. Symmetric HID design

There are symmetric designs among the HID pressure designs (i.e.,
HID 1 and HID 3, HID 2 and HID 5, and HID 4 and HID 6). Symmetric de-
sign refers to the same membrane conguration used in a different po-
sition. For example, HID 1 and HID 3 consist of the SW30XHR-400i (high
rejection membrane) and SW30HRLE-400i (standard membrane)
models. In the HID 1 design, the high rejection membrane was posi-
tioned on the front side of the vessel. However, high rejection mem-
branes were positioned on the tail side of the vessel in the HID 2
design. All the symmetric designs show that HID 3, HID 5, and HID 6
possessing high-ux membranes on the front side have higher salt re-
jection rate and lower SEC (Fig. 2).
Fig. 4 shows the recovery rate of each element as a function of total
recovery rate. The commercial membrane element has its own limit re-
covery rate (13%) and design ux. The limit recovery rates and maxi-
mum permeate ux are determined by the fouling tendency of feed
seawater, which was Silt Density Index (SDI) value, used b 5 (conven-
tional pretreatment of open intake). The maximum design recovery
rate of the PV is just 40% for general feed conditions (TDS 35000 mg/L,
temperature 20 ∼C, and pH 8.2) when higher ux membrane elements
are located in the front position. This maximum design recovery rate
is because of exceeding the recovery rate limit or maximum design

ux by N 40% of the recovery rate. However, when higher ux mem-
brane elements are located in the tail position, the maximum design re-
covery rate is 50%. Maximum design recovery rates could be determined
by feed water quality (e.g., TDS and temperature). Nevertheless, when a
higher ux membrane is located in the tail position, the design recovery
rate range is relatively large. The best location for high-ux membranes
is in the tail position to design a high recovery rate.
The advantage of an ISD is the elimination of unbalanced ux distri-
bution problems. An unbalanced ux distribution causes a relatively
high ux in the front position elements; thus, their ux easily exceeds
the ux limit and recovery rate that may be the initial point of fouling.
HID 6 has an unbalanced ux distribution at 30% recovery and is consid-
erably more severe than HID 4. The HID 4 permeate ow rate of the rst
front position element (13.25 m3/d) is 2.11 times higher than that posi-
tioned on the last tail (6.27 m3/d). HID 6 permeate ow rates of the rst
front position element (19.1 m3/d) are 4.26 times higher than those po-
sitioned on the last tail (4.48 m3/d). HID 4 permeate ow rates of the
rst front position element (24.18 m3/d) at 50% recovery are 3.04
times higher than those positioned on the last tail (7.95 m3/d). HID 6
permeate ow rates of the rst front position element (34.1 m3/d) are
5.76 times higher than those positioned on the last tail (5.91 m3/d).
Broad design range and low fouling result when higher ux membranes
are located on tail position elements instead of front position elements.

3.3. Case study

3.3.1. Optimal recovery rate
Fig. 5 shows the optimal recovery rate with SEC at Case 1, Case 2 and
Case 3. In the Case 1, the XHR, HRLE, HID 1, and HID 2 PV designs can op-
erate at the optimal recovery rate (45%). However, ULE, HID 3, HID 4,
HID 5, and HID 6 cannot operate at this level owing to the design guide-
lines for maximum element recovery rate and recommended element
permeate ow which were suggested by the membrane manufacturer.
Average ux is 13.46, 15.38, and 17.3 LMH at 35%, 40%, and 45% recovery
rates, respectively. The highest SEC value is 6.6 kWh/m3 at the XHR de-
sign 30% recovery rate, and the lowest SEC value is 5.19 kWh/m3 at the
ULE design 40% recovery rate.
Also, the designs which were operated on optimal recovery rate
(50%) were XHR, HID1, and HID 2 in the Case 2. The highest SEC value
is 5.44 kWh/m3 at the XHR design 30% recovery rate, and the lowest
SEC value is 4.25 kWh/m3 at the ULE design 40% recovery rate. Allow-
able recovery rates of XHR and HID 3 are higher than those of Case 1.
In the Case 3, optimal recovery rates were changed by each PV design.
The optimal recovery rates were 50%, HRLE, HID1, HID 2, and HID 4,
and 45% XHR. The highest SEC value is 6.42 kWh/m3 at the XHR 30% de-
sign recovery rate, and the lowest SEC value is 4.86 kWh/m3 at the ULE
design 40% recovery rate. Front design (higher ux membrane located
on front position) showed high performance on the result Section 3.2.
However, Fig. 5 indicated that recovery rate ranges of these front design
which were HID 3, HID 5 and HID 6 was limited on high temperature
feed conditions (Case 1 and Case 2).

3.3.2. TDS and boron rejection
Fig. 6 shows the permeate TDS and boron concentration by compar-
ing SEC at each possible recovery rate. Although XHR, HRLE, HID 1, HID
3, and HID 5 can satisfy the TDS standard concentration over an entire
range of recovery rates on Case 1 feed condition, the ULE PV design

cannot. Moreover, the HID 4 and HID 6 designs can operate at only
45% (permeate TDS 394.45 mg/L) and 35% (permeate TDS 389.39 mg/
L). The HID 2 design can operate from 40% (permeate TDS 384.79 mg/
L) to 50% (permeate TDS 360.72 mg/L). While XHR and HID 3 can satisfy
the boron standard concentration for water products on an entire range
of recovery rates, ULE, HID 2, HID 4, HID 5, and HID 6 PV designs cannot.
Furthermore, the HID 1 design can operate except at 30% (permeate
boron concentration 1.00 mg/L), and the HRLE design can operate
from 40% (permeate boron concentration 0.98 mg/L) to 45% (permeate
boron concentration 0.95 mg/L). The limiting factor is the permeate
boron concentration for an SWRO single-pass plant in the Case 1. Opti-
mal PV design is the HRLE at 45% recovery rate. The lowest SEC is
5.52 kWh/m3 without ERD.
Similar results were shown on Case 2. This TDS value was relatively
less than that of Case 1, but temperature was high (32 ∼C). However, the
optimal design results by permeate TDS equal to Case 1, even if TDS
value was totally different.
The operating conditions of the HID 4 and HID 6 designs are only 45%
(permeate TDS 396.71 mg/L) and 35% (permeate TDS 392.25 mg/L), re-
spectively. The HID 2 design can operate from 40% (permeate TDS
387.22 mg/L) to 50% (permeate TDS 362.52 mg/L). Also, Case 2 design
limiting factor for PV optimization was permeate boron concentration.
Optimal PV design is HID 1 at 50% recovery rate. The SEC is 4.30 kWh/
m3.
In Case 3, overall PV design can operate on all recovery rates ranges.
TDS values are not a limiting factor in the single-pass SWRO process
owing to the low temperature of the feed water. XHR, HRLE, HID 1,
and HID 3 have no limiting operating recovery rates for boron stan-
dards. Moreover, HID 4 and HID 6 designs can operate at 40% (permeate
boron concentration 0.99 mg/L) and 50% (permeate boron concentra-
tion 0.98 mg/L). The HID 2 design can operate from 40% (permeate
boron concentration 0.98 mg/L) to 50% (permeate boron concentration
1.02 mg/L) and the HID 5 design can operate, except at 30% (permeate
boron concentration 1.00 mg/L). So, optimal PV design is HID 1 at 50%
recovery rate. The SEC is 4.30 kWh/m3 without ERD under an optimal
pressure vessel condition.

3.4. Analysis of case study

Case 1 and Case 2's TDS concentrations are completely different
(40,200 mg/L and 33,000 mg/L), but optimal PV design is the same for
a permeate 400 mg/L TDS concentration. Optimal PV design for TDS is
signicantly related to the temperature rather than the concentration
of the feed. However, a high TDS value in Case 1 causes high osmotic
pressure at the tail of the PV and increases the operational pressure in
all vessels. Although the optimal PV design in Case 2 is the same as
the Case 1n case for permeate TDS concentration, SEC is apparently dif-
ferent owing to TDS concentration.
Maximum recovery rate of a PV is affected by feed TDS, temperature,
and front position membrane type. Low TDS, high-ux membrane, and
high temperature in Case 2 cause high permeate ux of membrane ele-
ments on the front position of HID 5, HID 6, and ULE. Maximum recov-
ery rates of membrane elements in the front position are limited as seen
for HID 6 in Fig. 4. Therefore, they can operate, even in the smallest
range. In contrast, maximum recovery rates for Case 3 are determined
only by the recovery rate limitation of front position membrane type
owing to the low temperature and general TDS values. Increased

temperature in feed increases ux and TDS concentration in permeate.
Thus, in Case 1 and Case 2, portions of the HID PVs cannot be applied
to control TDS values below 400 mg/L.
In the single-train design, the most important parameter is boron
concentration. The range of HID is limited beyond that for controlling
the TDS concentration to keep the boron concentration below 1 mg/L.
The boron concentration in permeate is more sensitive to feed temper-
ature as it is similar in all three cases. Therefore, SW30XHR-400i is nec-
essary for boron control at 32 ∼C (Case 2), which is the highest
temperature in this study, despite a lower boron concentration than in
Case 1. HRLE in the Case 1 could satisfy 1 mg/L of the boron concentra-
tion. In contrast, SW30ULE-400i in the Case 3 could be applied to HID in
the PV owing to the low temperature. These results indicate that a com-
bination of high-ux membranes in HID is thoroughly dependent on
feed temperature to control TDS or boron concentration.
Tab le 4 shows the opt ima l HID in each respect ive case and the
importance of HID. The HRLE (45%) design was selected as the opti-
mal PV design for the feed quality in Case 1 because the high 28 ∼C
temperature b locks the app l icat ion o f the SW30ULE-400 i in H ID .

respectively. In contrast, the optimal PV designs when the HID tech-
nique is applied are the HID 1 (50%) and HID 4 (50%) designs in Case

m3, respectively, and SEC of HID 4 (50%) and HRLE (50%) are 4.99 kWh/
m3 and 5.40 kWh/m3, respectively. When applying the HID technique,
0.17 and 0.41 kWh/m3 are reduced with same recovery rate and same
feed qualities. Consequently, the HID technique can optimize PV design
more specically for various feed qualities.

3.5. Critical design factors of HID

Many design factors inuence HID design. The salt rejection rates of
HID are determined by temperature and recovery rate. Temperature
causes changes in salt ux on the membrane. Average ux of PV is de-
termined by recovery rates and thus the total rejection also changes. It
has been mentioned that permeate boron concentration is a vital crite-
rion for HID design according to previous results. Therefore, the allow-
able boron concentration of feed water was investigated to determine
the critical design factor for HID. Fig. 7 shows the allowable feed boron
concentration for each PV design. Each membrane type has a different
change in allowable feed boron concentration depending on tempera-
ture and recovery rate. HID results indicate that boron rejection is signif-
icantly affected by membrane type. HID 2, HID 4, HID 5, and HID 6 used a
SW30ULE-400i membrane. However, HID 1 and HID 3 did not use the
SW30ULE-400i membrane.
The ULE design does not signicantly change with temperature
and recovery rate . HID 2 , HID 4 , HID 5 , and HID 6 also follow their
compos ition membrane types , wh ich are ULE membranes . A l low-
ab le feed boron concentration changes with temperature and re-
covery rate in the same membrane conguration. Temperature has
a greater difference than the recovery rates of both the conventional
design and HID between these two design factors . The highest a l-
lowab le feed boron concent ra t ion o f XHR dec reases by 19 .74%
from 11 .51 mg /L (20 ∼C) to 6 .82 mg /L (30 ∼C) a t a 50% recovery
rate by temperature change but by 39 .20% from 11 .51 mg/L (50%)
to 9 .24 mg/L (30%) a t a temperature o f 30 ∼C by recovery rate
change. XHR results show that temperature has more inuence on
allowable boron feed concentration than recovery rate.
HID also has the same results with conventional design. The highest
allowable feed boron concentration of HID 3 decreased by 19.32% from
9.89 mg/L (50% recovery rate) to 7.98 mg/L (30% recovery rate) at a
temperature of 20 ∼C and by 38.46% from 9.89 mg/L (20 ∼C) to
4.91 mg/L (30 ∼C) at 50% recovery rate by temperature change. High
temperatures narrow the range of allowable feed boron concentration.

However, low temperature and high recovery rate expand the range of al-
lowable feed boron concentration. This indicates that there are no signif-
icant performance differences among the HID and conventional designs
at high temperature ranges. Accordingly, HID could be used more effec-
tively at low temperature ranges, because results Section 3.1 already

shows that the advantage of HID redeem the difference of design capacity
to satisfy the required quality by the relationship between rejection rate
and SEC. If the differences of design capacity are narrowed, HID design
will show less benet of tailoring the process performance with a margin-
al difference comparing to the conventional design.

4. Conclusions

This work reports the optimal combination of RO membranes in PVs
with various feed qualities using three distinguished commercial mem-
branes: high-rejection, standard, and high-ux. This study investigated
the module conguration and determined the effect of element position

in PV. The tail position showed more effect on water quality but the
front membrane conguration in the PV inuenced more impact on
ux. This means the position of high-ux membranes in the PV may de-
termine permeate quality and SEC. Therefore, module conguration can
be designed to control water quality level or energy reduction depend-
ing on feed water concentration and temperature.

HID can partially supplement the range designed by a single RO
membrane type. RO membrane types and positions in the PV affected
the performance in this study. Optimal design of RO membrane cong-
uration in the PV is greatly changed depending on the design parame-
ters, particularly temperature. This is considered important in single-
pass train design where the control of boron concentration is more
sensitive to the feed temperature than other parameters. The use of
high-ux membrane limits permeate quality by feed temperature.
However, HID could be used to optimize PV design in more detail
with various feed qualities.
