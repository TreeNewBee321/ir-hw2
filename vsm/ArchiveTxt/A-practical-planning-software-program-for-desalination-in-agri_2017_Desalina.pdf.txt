abstract

Water shortage limits agricultural production worldwide, and irrigation leads to a rapid depletion of water re-
sources. Using desalinated water for irrigation reduces pressure on local resources but it is expensive. An eco-
nomically viable utilization for using desalinated water in agriculture is only possible through the optimal
planning and management of cropland and irrigation scheduling management. We developed a software pro-
gram aiming to maximize the gross margin (GM) by optimizing cropping patterns using a site-specic crop
water requirement model. We used the simplex algorithm under the boundary conditions of limited water (tem-
poral scale) and available land (spatial scale). In a proof of concept, we tested the software for a desalination plant
in Saudi Arabia that produces 60,000 m3 day1. A cropping pattern for 4278 ha was derived that maximizes GM
(92 Mio US$ yr1) and uses most (97%) of the constant water supply to the plant. An optimal cropping pattern
(4023 ha) solely maximizing GM yields a higher outcome (125 Mio US$ yr1) and requires even less water for
irrigation. This surplus water can be used for leaching soils or other purposes. Both cropping patterns are domi-
nated by cucumber and tomatoes, covering the largest fractions of cropland at 74% and 88%, respectively.

1. Introduction

1.1. Agricultural development by desalination
A vast increase in food prices on the global market has been observed
since 2003, and several reasons have been discussed, e.g., weather shocks,
increasing oil prices and nancial market speculation [1]. Prices for prima-
ry commodities, such as rice, wheat, soybean and maize, increased three-
fold or more until peaking in 2008. After that, the prices dropped again. In-
vestments in agricultural research and development are helpful to pre-
vent food prices from undergoing such severe increases [2]. Because
many regions worldwide face an increasing unsustainable use of local
water resources [3] and increasingly rely on foreign water resources to
support their growing populations [4], alternative pathways must be de-
veloped to support agriculture with water because the current solutions
are often closely associated with local water resource depletion [5,6].
The desalination of seawater provides such an alternative and may be
helpful to partly counteract water scarcity [7]. In particular, comprehen-
sive investments in large-scale desalination are needed to ensure a sus-
tainable development as reported for the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries (GCC) [8]. The question arises as to how available water re-
sources from new investments, as well as existing ones, can be used opti-
mally. The importance of modelling tools has been recently highlighted to
solve such integrated problems regarding the energy, water and food
nexus [9] and to ensure a sustainable use of desalinated seawater for ag-
riculture [10]. In this study, a novel spatial decision support system
(sDSS) is presented to optimize desalinated water use for agriculture. Be-
cause optimal agriculture management is important to successfully utilize
desalinated water for irrigation [11], a particular emphasis is given to the
factors of irrigation technology, salinity and crop salt tolerance, which
have been reported to be major determinants for investigating the poten-
tial of agricultural production on the Arabian Peninsula [12]. It has been
shown that irrigation technology has a high impact on the national
water consumption [13] because changes in cropping pattern as well as
the implementation of modern irrigation technology can reduce water
consumption by up to 32% in Saudi Arabia [14].

1.2. Desalination technology and cost

Improved desalination techniques [15] may reshape agricultural pro-
duction. The applicability of different desalination techniques to provide
water for irrigation has been recently reviewed [11], and the authors stress
the suitability of reverse osmosis (RO) for agriculture purposes. However,
Shaffer et al. [16] highlight the potential of forward osmosis technology
coupled with RO for agriculture purposes compared to the sole application
of RO because of its better water quality at lower costs. Efforts have been
made to use renewable energy for running plants, e.g., by photovoltaic
power, wind power or solar energy, and the feasibility of the application
of desalination with renewable energy has been discussed widely [17,18].
The costs for desalinated water are still high compared to the utiliza-
tion of surface or groundwater for irrigation because the latter ones
have no or only low prices in most countries. In most cases, only
pumping costs are incurred. Generally, it is often unclear whether the
cost for desalination includes capital and investment costs or the
planned lifespan of the desalination plant [19®C21], which makes dif-
cult a general comparison of literature data on desalination costs. For
example, the price for desalination using RO ranges between 0.5 and
1.2 US$ m 3 [19], which is high compared to the water costs of
0.05  m 3, as reported for an irrigation district in Spain [22] using sur-
face water resources for irrigation. The key question is as follows: how
much are farmers willing to pay? Barron et al. [23] conducted a nation-
wide study in Australia based on various datasets of water availability,
quality and economic aspects and stated that farmers a likely to spend
no N 1.2 AU$ m 3 (1.0 AU$®C0.7 US$). In contrast, a water price between
0.14 and 0.35 US$ m 3 has been reported for an irrigation district in Jor-
dan [24]. Overall, desalinated water remains an expensive resource, and
its consumption should be managed properly to avoid wasting precious
water and to ensure an economically feasible utilization.

1.3. Optimization of water allocation

To optimize water resource use, different scales and factors must be
considered, i.e., (i) the spatial allocation of water (e.g., between districts)
[22,25,26], (ii) the crop selection and cropping patterns [26] and (iii) the
timing of the crop irrigation schedule [27], in addition to the amount of
available irrigation water. The optimization of cropping pattern is often
conducted by coupled crop water economic optimization models, as-
suming a xed water supply. The optimization is often performed in a

hierarchical way, e.g., Garcia-Vila and Fereres [22] derived crop produc-
tivity functions for site-specic conditions with a dynamic crop model
(AquaCrop [28,29]) under various supplies. These functions are then
used in a second step in an economic model to optimize management.
Reca et al. [30] used a three-step hierarchical system to optimize water
use: on the eld level for single crops, on the district level for cropping
pattern and on a hydrological system scale for complete land cover.
Pandey et al. [31] used the Cropwat model [32] in a three-phase ap-
proach to optimize the eld level water use as well as the cropping pat-
tern. Shanguuan et al. [33] applied in their hierarchical approach three
layers with different objectives in order to maximize crop yields, the ben-
et of the cropping pattern and the benet at the basin scale. The objec-
tive functions that are commonly optimized is the gross margin [22,25],
the water use efciency, or a combination of both. Others optimize the
gross income, net income, irrigation water productivity or labour use
[26], as well as crop yield [34]. Net farm income, minimization of
waterlogging and minimization of groundwater depletion are listed in
another review [35]. Most optimization approaches are restricted by lim-
itations, e.g., maximum and minimum percentages for each crop to pre-
vent optimization for favouring only high-value crops [25], land and
water availability [31] and irrigation depth [30]. Such limitations are im-
plemented by penalty functions [25] or limited parameter ranges as is
often the case for cropping patterns [30].
Mathematical algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem.
Four methods, i.e., linear, non-linear and dynamic programming and a ge-
netic algorithm, have been recently discussed in the context of irrigation
management optimization [35]. To solve nonlinear problems, simulated
annealing (SA) comes into play. The simulated annealing approach has
been recently reviewed for conjunctive water use management, and the
practicability of combining optimization approaches and simulation
models has been highlighted [36]. Brown et al. [37] used such a coupled
approach to optimize irrigation scheduling using simulated annealing
and the FarmWi$e/APSIM model. They showed that pasture yields could
be increased by 10% through optimal irrigation scheduling in Canterbury
(New Zealand). In the case of multi-objective optimization problems,
which are limited by several constraints, linear programming is an
often-applied method. A popular linear programming optimization meth-
od is the simplex algorithm [38,39]. This algorithm enables an effective
and straightforward implementation of boundary conditions, which is im-
portant in the case of planning land use under a limited water supply and
other constraints. Sadeghi et al. [40] optimized the management of a wa-
tershed in Iran using the simplex method, showing that soil erosion could
be reduced and the net benets increased through the optimal planning
of orchards, irrigation and dryland farming. Khare et al. [41] utilized an
economic engineering optimization model based on the simplex algo-
rithm. They derived optimal cropping patterns supplied by either surface
or groundwater for a planned canal system in India. The results indicate
potential water saving through inter-basin water trade. Chen et al. [42]
applied the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects (iCLUE) program,
which implements the simplex method for optimizing land-use pattern
for an area in Northern China. The authors highlight the practicability of
the proposed method to ensure ecological security at the regional scale.

1.4. Study objective

Countries experiencing food price shocks as observed in the last de-
cade [1] require measures to increase resilience. This leads to the need
for further investments in research and development in the agricultural
sector [2]. As part of Saudi Arabia's strategy to cope with limited water re-
sources, desalination is proposed as one measure to address water short-
age [8]. Given that agriculture is the largest water-consuming sector in
Saudi Arabia, constituting N 90% of the total water use [43], there is greater
potential to improve irrigation management in order to make the best use
of this expensive resource. Potential strategies to improve desalinated sea-
water use in agriculture include the spatial reallocation of crops, the diver-
sication of cropping patterns and the optimization of water use over time

by balancing supply and demand. A new sDSS for planning and optimizing
desalinated water use in agriculture has been developed because the im-
portance of modelling tools in such a context has been recently highlight-
ed [10]. A software package has been implemented called
SPARE:WATERopt aiming at the temporal and spatial economic optimiza-
tion of cropping patterns according to limited water and land availability.
The newly developed software SPARE:WATERopt is an extension to the
previous published software tool SPARE:WATER [5]. A case study was pre-
sented of a RO desalination plant in eastern Saudi Arabia along the Arabian
Gulf with a daily water production of 60,000 m3 day1. The irrigated elds
near the desalinated plant sum to 84,753 ha, which is considered the total
potential area for irrigation agriculture in this study. The simplex algo-
rithm [38,39] was used to plan cropping patterns by maximizing the
gross margin under limited water and available land. The site-specic
monthly crop water needs for 19 major crops grown in Saudi Arabia and
their different sowing dates were taken from a database calculated using
SPARE:WATER in a previous study (Multsch et al., 2016b). Two strategies
are addressed in order to determine the optimal cropping patterns for the
irrigation with desalinated water.

2. Methods and materials

2.1. Modelling framework

The framework °∞SPARE:WATERopt°± proposed in this study(Fig. 1) aims
to support the planning of cropping patterns in arid and semi-arid regions,
where land and water resources limit agriculture. The software was made
for various stakeholders, such as farmers, engineers, authorities and pri-
vate companies (Fig. 1a), but can of course be used for further research.
The software was implemented with VB°§NET for Windows computers
with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI enables the conguration
of the model, e.g., selection of region, crops, scenario settings and bound-
ary conditions (Fig. 1b). The user can set up the software step by step in
order to dene the scenario, regions and available crops or can load a
pre-dened setup from .csv les in batch run mode. Optimization with
the simplex algorithm was conducted with a script written in the Python
programming language. We used the SciPy package and its linear

programming features (Fig. 1c). The GUI and the script use of a database
in SQLite, which contains information on arable land, prices, crop water
needs and the results of the optimization, i.e., the cropping pattern and
the related costs, revenues and GM (Fig. 1d).
In the rst step, the user creates a scenario. This contains the denition
of the water supply, water cost and objective function, as well as the irri-
gation management parameters (salinity control, efciency and technolo-
gy). The second step is the denition of the regions that should be supplied
and the crops that can be grown according to a given irrigation technology.
In the third step, the user sets boundary conditions related to minimum
and maximum available arable land for specic crop types. By running
this setup, the simplex algorithm determines the optimal cropping pattern
in relation to the objective function and boundary conditions. The results
are stored in the database, and three graphs in the GUI show the annual
water demand and GM, as well as the monthly water needs of each crop
per month in relation to the monthly water supply.

2.1.1. Water balance
The cropping patterns to be developed consider the limited monthly
water supply and available land in each region. For this reason, the user
must provide data on the monthly net irrigation requirements, i.e., the
productive amount of irrigation that actually contributes to crop growth
(IRRprod) for each crop and region. These data can be derived by eld ex-
periments or by simulation models [5,29]. These simulation models re-
quire input information on the management, soil and climate, which are
available, for example, from public datasets from the FAO (soil: [44]; cli-
mate: [45]) or local authorities. IRRprod is the amount of water needed to
allow full crop growth considering no limitations through pests, diseases,
or nutrient or water stress. Nevertheless, irrigation losses can occur
through deep percolation (i.e., water ow to deeper soil layers or ground-
water) [46]. Thus, IRRprod is adjusted by the irrigation efciency (IRReff) to
include these water losses. In our study, water losses are related to on-
farm processes. Off-farm losses, such as those through canal cracks, are
neglected.
Salinization is another important process to be considered. When
water evaporates from the soil, salts remain in the rooting zone, limiting
plant water uptake, decreasing crop yields and impacting soil structure

[47]. In the worst case, salt crusts seal the soil surface, making crop cultiva-
tion impossible. Therefore, salinity management plays a major role when
water of lower quality (i.e., with a high salt content) is used for irrigation.
Desalinated water is of high quality and may not lead to salinization, but in
case of blending or partially desalinated water, this problem becomes par-
ticularly evident. Hence, management by means of additional irrigation
(leaching requirement, LR) to wash out the salt from the rooting zone is
an important task [48®C51]. Based on these assumptions, the gross irriga-
tion requirement (IRRgross) is derived as follows:

IRRgross  IRRprod

IRReff

 LR

1

with IRRgross, IRRprod and LR in cubic metres per hectare (m3 ha 1) and
IRReff in percent (%). The losses from inefcient irrigation, which do not
contribute to crop growth (IRRunprod), are assumed to percolate. These
water losses can fully or partly cover LR [50]. Thus, LR refers only to the ad-
ditional leaching requirement when IRRunprod cannot cover the potential
LR. The potential leaching requirement is calculated according to Ayers
and Westcot [51] based on the crop's tolerable salt concentration in the
rooting zone (ECe), the salinity of the irrigation water (ECw) and IRRprod [5].

2.1.2. Economic balance
The economic balance is determined for a cropping pattern, which is
planned for one year. Costs refer to desalination (cdesal) costs and the
costs to pump water from the desalination plant to the elds (ctrans). The
costs refer to units of water per cubic metre multiplied by the gross irriga-
tion (IRRgross) per crop and region. The revenue is calculated by multiply-
ing the crop yield per hectare (CY) by the harvest area (x) and the
producer price (Price). GM is calculated as follows for each region (r)
and crop (c):

gmr ;c  Pricec  CY r ;c  xr ;c







Revenue

 IRRgrossr ;c  ctrans  cdesal

with cdesal and ctrans in US dollars per cubic metre (US$ m3), IRRgross in
cubic metres per hectare (m3 ha1), Price in US dollars per tonne (US$
t 1), CY in tonnes per hectare (t ha 1), harvest area x in hectares per
year (ha yr 1) and gm in US dollars per hectare (US$ ha 1). The total
GM is derived by summing gmr,c.

2.1.3. Optimization algorithm
The goal of this study is to identify the cropping patterns that make the
best use of limited water resources for irrigation agriculture. Hence, a
cropping pattern needs to maximize the GM and makes the best use of
the water supply by desalination. Transport costs may limit the GM of
elds far from the water source. Available cropland restricts the extent
of irrigation areas in each region. Furthermore, the harvest area of some
crops may be restricted to adjust the algorithm to specic objectives,
e.g., limit the maximum area of cash crops or dene the minimum areas
for staple foods. This algorithm maximizes the objective function by
selecting the optimal cropping pattern as follows:

max GM

with the total GM (US$ yr1), gm (US$ ha1), and harvest area x (ha yr1)
for all regions r and all crops c, as well as the total number of regions R and
the total number of crops C. In order to consider the boundary conditions,
such as limited available arable land or limited available water, the objec-
tive function is subjected to a set of boundary conditions (i.e., inequality
and equality constraints):

ainequality  x °‹ binequality
 x  bequality

with (i) the upper bound inequality constraint ainequality in harvest area x
and the upper boundary value binequality, as well as (ii) the upper bound
equality constraint aequality in harvest area x and the values of each equality
bequality. Eq. (4) represents the general form and is solved for three con-
straints, which limit the selection of the possible cropping pattern. The
rst boundary condition relates the monthly irrigation water requirement
per crop and region to the total monthly water supply. This boundary con-
dition (°Æmonthly water supply limit°Ø) is obligatory:

where IRRgross M,R,C is the irrigation requirement per hectare for all crops

The second boundary condition is optional (Eq. (6)) (°Æuse all available
water°Ø). If activated, it forces the algorithm to use at least a minimum frac-
tion of the available water WUmin, 0 °‹ WUmin °‹ 1. WUmin was set to 0.95 in
this study in order to account for a small deviation from the boundary
conditions. For higher WUmin, the optimization algorithm has difculty
nding an optimal solution. This boundary condition is optional:

The third boundary condition (Eq. (7)) (°Ælimited available cropland°Ø)
restricts the sum of the harvest area of all crops in a region to the avail-
able cropland in each region, whereby the upper bound inequality con-
straint a has a Boolean value (0 or 1), which indicates whether or not
the restriction is applied to the combination of crop and region:

with bool between 0 and 1 and potential cropland CL. Moreover, the
software provides the ability to implement boundary conditions for
the upper and lower limits of the harvest area of certain crops, i.e., to
limit the area of cash crops or to produce at least the minima of staple
foods. The objective function (3) and all of the inequality constraints
(4®C7) are linear functions. As such, the problem can be solved using a
linear optimization method. One common method is the simplex algo-
rithm [38,39], which has been implemented in many scientic pro-
gramming tools, including the Python package SciPy [52]. This linear
optimization problem is convex, and the simplex algorithm is guaran-
teed to nd the global optimum, i.e., the best possible cropping pattern
satisfying all of the selected constraints.

2.2. Database and study site

As a proof of concept, we applied our method in a case study for a de-
salination plant close to Al-Khafjy (Saudi Arabia). Table 1 gives a sum-
mary of the input data and sources. The information of the geographic
location of irrigated areas was derived from the Global Map of Irrigated

Areas [53]. The cropland is ~ 200 km from south and south-west of Al-
Khafjy and covers an area of 240 km (E-W) °¡ 130 km (N-S). The climate
conditions follow a W-E trend (Appendix Fig. A2). The average temper-
ature slightly decreases from west to east (25®C27 °„C), and the average
humidity and wind speed increase from west to east (30®C42% and
1.86®C2.28 m s 1, respectively). No change is observed for sunshine
hours when western and eastern areas are compared. This leads to an
overall increasing W-E trend of reference evapotranspiration (2160®C
2400 mm yr 1). Rainfall is highest in the W and lowest in the E (108®C
132 mm yr 1). Data on the monthly crop irrigation requirements
(IRRprod) are available from a nationwide dataset of 3758 irrigated
sites in Saudi Arabia for 19 major crops and various planting dates
°∞SPARE:WATER/Plot-
(www.uni-giessen.de/cms/hydro/download,
scale irrigation requirements KSA°±) [14]. In detail, this database holds
values on IRRprod on the basis of high resolution gridded environmental
data (0.063°„) and long term climatic observations averaged from 1986
to 2006. The data shows a good t in comparison to other modelling
studies and eld information in Saudi Arabia [14]. IRReff and the irriga-
tion technology are uniform in space, but with varying values among
crop types. We have assumed modern irrigation technology, i.e. sprin-
kler irrigation for cereals and fodder crops as well as drip irrigation for
vegetables and fruits. The respective efciencies are 0.70 and 0.85 for
sprinkler and drip systems [54,55]. The data on crop yields were taken
from statistics for each province in Saudi Arabia derived from the Min-
istry of Agriculture for the year 2011. Prices of the crops were taken
from the FAOSTAT database [56] for Saudi Arabia, derived from the glob-
al average, or taken from other open-access sources if national prices
were missing for specic crops (Fig. A4). Transport costs were derived
from the vertical and horizontal pumping cost of water,
i.e.,
0.05 US$ m 3 100 km horizontal and 100 m vertical [20] (Appendix
Fig. A1). The desalination cost for RO was recently reported to be 0.5
to 1.2 US$ m 3 for RO [19]. Thus, we assumed desalination costs of
0.75 US$ m 3. The daily production of Al-Khafjy was assumed to be
60,000 m3 day 1 (21,900,000 m3 yr 1) with an electric conductivity
of 1.0 dS m 1 (1.0 dS m 1®C640 mg L 1).
We address two strategies to derive GM maximized cropping pat-
terns. With Strategy I, we aim to maximize the GM and to use 95% of
the available water from the desalination plant. Such a strategy may
be important, particularly when no capacity for storing surplus water
is available. All three of the boundary conditions in Eqs. (5)®C(7) are con-
sidered. Strategy II aims to solely maximize the gross margin and refers
to Eqs. (5) and (7) only.

3. Results

3.1. Monthly irrigation demand and gross margin

A cropping pattern was derived for Strategy I, i.e., maximizing GM by
using most of the available water given the limited available cropland.
The annual water consumption of the resulting cropping pattern sums
to 21.318 Mio m3 yr 1 for one year (92% of the annual water supply

millet, maize, cucumber and barley the rest of it. Most of the water is
consumed by tomatoes (49%), followed by sesame (25%) and millet
(13%) (Fig. 2a, c). Notably, 10% of the cropland (sesame) consumes
25% of the available water. The production of sesame is economically

( 8287 US$ ha 1). The boundary condition that all of the available
water should be consumed (Eq. (5)) leads to the cultivation of these
economically unproductive crops. Hence, we investigated a second
strategy without needing to use all of the available water.
The sole maximization of the GM under limited land and water
availability in Strategy II leads to total an annual water consumption
of 16.945 Mio m3 yr 1 (Fig. 3a,c). This is 77% of the available water
from desalination, providing a total GM of 125.131 Mio US$ yr 1 (Fig.
3b). Tomatoes (43%), cucumbers (56%) and a small fraction of millet
(2%) constitute the majority of the GM (Table 2). The distribution of
water demands across cultivated crops shows a different partitioning
compared to that of Strategy I as reported in Table 2. A high fraction of
IRRgross is attributed to millet (25%), despite its low share (12%) of the
total harvested area. In contrast, tomatoes require the same portion of
IRRgross but cover 45% of the harvest area. Cucumber and tomatoes are
grown on 4022 ha (almost 90% of the cultivated cropland) (Fig. 3d). Cul-
tivating cucumber achieves the highest economic yield of approximate-
ly 39,000 US$ ha 1 compared to that of tomatoes (~ 30,000 US$ ha 1),
but this is associated with a nearly two-times-higher water demand
(4734 m3 ha 1) compared to that of tomatoes (2604 m3 ha 1). The
lowest economic yield is achieved with millet (4754 US$ ha 1), paired
with the highest water demand (9053 m3 ha 1) of all crops in Strategy
II (Table 2). Nevertheless, the GM is still positive, which is not the case
for millet in Strategy I.

3.2. Regional allocation and comparative advantages

The regional distribution of the cropping pattern for Strategy I is shown
in Fig. 4a. The crops are cultivated along the edges of the available cropland
in the NW, W and SE. The boxplots in Fig. 4b illustrate the span of IRRgross
on all of the potentially cultivated cropland (grey shaded area in Fig. 4a).
Asterisks indicate the average IRRgross of the actually cultivated areas as al-
located by the simplex algorithm. Some crops are cultivated in elds,
which have a higher IRRgross compared to the average IRRgross of the entire
cropland, as shown in Fig. 4b by the asterisks that are outside of the
boxplots to the right. This is the case for barley, maize, millet and sesame,
where the average IRRgross of cultivated crops is higher than the average of
the potential areas by 54, 12, 26 and 46%, respectively. These crops are cul-
tivated on less productive areas regarding irrigation demand. Other crops,
such as cucumber and tomatoes, are in most cases grown in comparable
productive areas, as shown by the low average IRRgross of the cultivated
areas, which lies within the limits of the IQR of all potential areas or
which is even lower than the average of the potential areas, such as for
cucumber.
A likely reason for the heterogeneous spatial allocation of the crops
is the producer price. Cucumber and tomatoes are cash crops with the
highest prot compared to that of cereals, such as millet. These crops
are allocated to the areas with the best growing conditions as deter-
mined by the simplex algorithm. Another reason is the boundary condi-
tion °Æuse all available water.°Ø This condition may lead to situations where
a better location for crop growth (i.e., lower IRRgross) is not selected for a
specic crop because it would not be in agreement with the boundary
condition. To test this hypothesis, the impact of WUmin on the regional

distribution of crops was investigated. We set WUmin = 0.85 in a second
model run with all other parameters xed (results not shown). In this
case, tomatoes were also grown on elds with a lower IRRgross than
the average of the potential arable areas. This supports our interpreta-
tion, and we conclude that maximizing water utilization can lead to
the cultivation of crops in comparable marginal arable elds in order
to maintain the boundary conditions.
The second strategy shows a different result regarding the spatial
distribution of actually cultivated areas. These areas are concentrated
towards the W and NW of the available cropland (Fig. 5a). The elds se-
lected by the algorithm also provide the best growing conditions. This is
represented by the low average IRRgross (asterisks in Fig. 4b and Fig. 5b)
of the actually cultivated areas (cucumber Feb.: 5068 m3 ha 1, cucum-
ber Sep.: 4352 m3 ha 1, tomato Nov.: 2428 m3 ha 1, tomato Oct.:
2772 m3 ha 1) compared to the IRRgross of all of the potentially cultivat-
ed cropland (represented by the boxplots in Fig. 4b and Fig. 5b). An ex-
ception is millet, which is sown in areas where the average IRRgross is
25% higher than the average of all regions. This nding for millet is sim-
ilar to Strategy I, where cereals with a lower economic value are sown in
the less productive areas.
Another interesting aspect is the general preference of cropland in
the W and NW. These areas have nearly the highest cost for pumping
water from the desalination plant in Al-Khafjy to the cropland (Appen-
dix Fig. A1). However, the reason for the preferable cultivation is the
better environmental conditions, i.e., higher rainfall rates and lower

4. Discussion

By comparing irrigation Strategies I and II, we show that economically
productive cropping patterns can be identied using desalinated seawater
at costs of 0.75 US$ m3. However, using all of the available water for ir-
rigating cropland does not necessarily lead to a higher GM, as shown in
Strategy I, which contains crops that are economically unproductive.
Thus, it is preferable to focus on a cropping pattern, which only maximizes
the GM as presented in Strategy II. In this case, surplus water can be stored,
used for domestic supply and industrial use, or applied to agricultural land
to leach salts from the root zone to maintain soil quality.
In our study, costs refer to desalination, water transport and revenues
to producer prices without considering potential subsidies. The assump-
tion is that the user of the proposed model knows the target salinity
level of the desalination plant, the daily production and the related costs
per cubic metre. These parameters and the producer price of eld crops
have a signicant impact on the determination of the cropping pattern
in view of maximizing the GM. Moreover, local environmental conditions
alter the irrigation requirement of eld crops as well as the irrigation man-
agement (i.e., irrigation technology, efciency, and salinity level). Due to
the complexity of the GM estimation, a comparison with other literature
data is difcult. Nevertheless, a rough evaluation of the economic produc-
tivity of irrigation with desalinated seawater can be made and is helpful to
put the results of our study into context. This evaluation was performed
for a cash crop (tomatoes) and a cereal with a lower economic value
(barley).
The cropping patterns that we calculated are dominated by the harvest
area of tomatoes and cucumber. Both have a high GM of approximately
30,000 and 39,000 US$ ha1, respectively. These results emphasize the
economic preference of specic vegetables. Similar results have been re-
ported by others within a modelling study growing tomatoes with desali-
nated brackish water from RO in Brazil [57]. The irrigation demand was
assumed to be 5 mm day1, and the authors assumed an initial yield of
40 t ha 1, resulting in an economic value between 42,440 (1 dS m 1)
and 28,590 US$ ha1 (6 dS m 1) for the different salinity levels. In the
study of an irrigation district in Spain, it was shown that the GM of barley
varies from 245 to 327  ha1 (0.10®C0.12  m3) [58] at costs of 0.06®C
0.15  m3 for water distribution, extraction and storage from a regional
groundwater store. The authors highlight that maximum benets are
achieved when using water efciently considering decit scheduling rath-
er than focusing on maximum yield production because the relative pro-
ductivity of additional irrigation decreases with higher yields. This GM is
high compared to that of our study, as we found a negative GM
( 3877 US$ ha1). This large difference can be attributed to a 1.7-fold-
higher IRRgross irrigation in our study as well as the lower costs for

irrigation water and subsidies of 220  ha1 in Spain. The crop yield of bar-
ley is comparable between both studies, at 5.8 and 6.5 t ha1 in Saudi Ara-
bia and Spain, respectively. This value is similar for similar crops, such as
wheat. In particular, low water costs lead to an economically valuable pro-
duction of barley in Spain. This is not possible using rather expensive de-
salinated water, as is available in Saudi Arabia. We acknowledge that the
environmental conditions and economic boundary conditions (subsidies,
cost for irrigation water, prices, crop yield, etc.) are not comparable to
those of our study, but this comparison emphasizes the general applicabil-
ity of optimization models to solve water allocation problems.
We also acknowledge that we did not consider other costs related to
farming practice, e.g., pesticides, fertilization, labour, machinery, harvest-
ing, and seeding and irrigation techniques, which may alter our results. In
particular, fertilization might play a major role because most minerals are
removed through the RO process. The additional minerals (Mg and Ca)
that need to be added to the irrigation water may cost approximately
0.09 US$ m 3 [59]. Alternatively, water blending with brackish water
has been reported as a method to add missing minerals [59,60]. However,
such a strategy could in turn increase the salt load to the rooting zone.
Crop selection, in particular that of salt-tolerant crop types [61], could
then become important.
As with all modelling studies, the quality of our results depends on the
input data, parameter uncertainty and model structural errors. For exam-
ple, different model structures and parametrizations can vary the predic-
tion of the irrigation demand of elds crops [62]. This is likely to feed
back into the results of the optimization algorithm and could be addressed
in future work by ensemble modelling and model-averaging techniques

[62®C64]. The cropping patterns derived by our optimization process are
unique. However, they could be biased by only slight advantages in the
model outputs of a target variable, e.g., a certain crop gains a minimal ad-
ditional GM compared to that of another crop and will be therefore select-
ed by the algorithm. Solutions with a slightly less favourable GM are not
considered, even though they might be more robust in view of other
model uncertainties. Such changes have been denoted as parameter per-
turbations [65], and it is important to nd °Ærobust°Ø solutions that are inde-
pendent of such perturbations. Robust optimization [66] has been
highlighted in the frame of water resource planning to address such un-
certainties, e.g., for designing optimal groundwater remediation systems
[67]. Overall, a comprehensive uncertainty assessment, including a
fuzzy-based selection of non-perfect cropping patterns, is needed and
should be considered in future model development.
The production of desalinated seawater remains expensive, and its ap-
plication for irrigation is justied considering other aspects of sustainabil-
ity in addition to the solely economic balance.

1. Irrigation agriculture in Saudi Arabia currently relies on pumping fos-
sil, non-renewable groundwater [43]. This results in a highly unsus-
tainable groundwater depletion [6].
2. The pumping of groundwater is energy demanding and costly. We
therefore analysed a nationwide dataset of groundwater depths
(Ministry of Agriculture) to quantify the total pumping cost. Assum-
ing a pumping cost of 0.05 US$ m 3 [20] for 100 m of vertical trans-
port, the national average cost is approximately 0.16 US$ m 1 given
an average well depth of 311 m (Fig. A3). These costs need to be

considered when comparing desalinated water use with pumping
groundwater for irrigation.
3. The production of agricultural commodities for local markets can in-
crease self-sufciency and foster independence from the global food
market and resilience against price shocks. For example, the national
food consumption of
tomatoes
sums
to
approximately
790,000 t yr 1 [56] in Saudi Arabia. According to Strategy II, an
area of 1776 ha can be cultivated with tomatoes, equal to 7% of the
national consumption but only approximately 0.2% of the total culti-
vated area (0.75 Mio ha in 2011). Hence, facilitating at least a partial
self-sufciency for some cash crops and staple food commodities
may be viable using desalinated seawater. Such developments are
important because Saudi Arabia relies on foreign water resources.
Mekonnen and Hoekstra [68] estimated that 66% of the national
water footprint of consumption (i.e., water consumed by goods and
services inside and outside of the country) is related to the import
of services and goods (1995®C2001). Such a combined analysis of de-
salination in the frame of the water-food nexus has been highlighted
for irrigation agriculture in Australia [23] and might be of importance
for Saudi Arabia and other countries.

In this study, the focus was on the determination of optimal
cropping patterns, i.e., crop selection. The importance of the latter has
been recently highlighted for Gulf Cooperation Council countries in
order to improve the efciency of domestic food production [69], dem-
onstrating the need for optimization tools for planning cropping pat-
terns based on environmental and economic aspects as presented here.

be further extended to any irrigation problem for which a number of
boundary conditions are given (e.g., legally xed allocation of the
amount of irrigation water, total available water from reservoirs or sur-
face waters, or reduced water resource availability due to climate
change).
Currently, the costs for desalination vary with different systems,
plant size and many other factors [19®C21]. The increasing use of solar
energy will further alter these costs. Vast solar energy investments
are, for example, planned in Saudi Arabia [70], aiming at a high capacity
of 41 GW. A global perspective of the applicability of solar desalination
indicated that MENA countries are highly amenable to such systems
[71]. This will likely decrease desalination costs and therefore change
optimal cropping patterns. Spatial decision support systems, such as
SPARE:WATER [5],
in combination with economic optimization
methods as proposed in this study, are helpful for evaluating the feasi-
bility of solar-driven seawater desalination and for use in irrigation ag-
riculture in the future.

5. Conclusions

Appendix A. Appendix

The proposed sDSS represents a newly developed tool to maximize
GM by optimizing cropping patterns under limited land and water
availability for desalinated water use in agriculture. This model is driven
by data on local crop water requirements, and the user can set specic
parameters regarding irrigation management, i.e., irrigation technology,
efciency, salinity control and crop salt tolerance. All of these parame-
ters are important when managing agriculture and water use in the Ara-
bian Peninsula [12].
A desalination plant is dened by its daily water production, water
price and water quality. Using a straightforward approach, our tool
can be easily adapted to other desalination plants and may be useful
to investigate the optimal water use of other systems. Optimization
has shown that crops could be cultivated even far from the desalination
plant. Hence, spatial aspects and distances should be considered when
optimizing desalinated seawater use in agriculture. This concept can
