abstract

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of computer vision system (CVS) to detect meat
defects of m. longissimus lumborum (LL) in industrial settings. The material consisted of 230 muscles.
Based on pH1 (45 min) and pH2 (24 h post-mortem) meat classication into quality groups was con-
ducted. To give more precise characterization of the raw material (proving the defect or not) the elec-
trical conductivity (EC), drip loss, thermal drip and water holding capacity (WHC) were determined. The
color of the meat in CIEL*a*b* and by CVS was measured and the study into how the CVS can be
employed in meat defect detection was done. It was found that it is possible to employ the CVS to detect
PSE (pale, soft, exudative) and DFD (dark, rm, dry) and to classify meat into quality groups. It was not
possible to differentiate RSE (red, soft, exudative) from RFN (red, rm, normal) meat in this study. The
highest accuracy of raw material classication using the CVS method was reported for the HSL (hue,
saturation, lightness) color parameters at 81.7%. Therefore, the computer vision system can be employed
for rapid analysis of the quality of pork m. longissimus lumborum under industrial conditions.

1. Introduction

Non-standard quality of the marketed pork causes signicant
problems for the meat industry (Florowski, Florowska, Kur, &
Pisula, 2013). The main issue associated with pork meat quality is
a high PSE (pale, soft, exudative) occurrence. This phenomenon has
drawn the attention of scientists and processors for many years
(Barbut et al., 2008; Van De Perre, Ceustermans, Leyten, & Geers,
2010). The PSE meat when compared to the normal meat (red,
rm, normal; RFN) is characterized by a lighter, unnaturally pale
color with varied saturation, deteriorated WHC, an increased meat
drip loss and soft consistency (Van de Perre and Permentier, 2010).
The product of such quality should not be used for the culinary
meat production since an excessive meat drip loss is negatively
perceived by the consumers. Moreover, the utilization of PSE meat
is hampered (Florowski et al., 2013), causing, inter alia, lower yield
of the nished product. The biggest disadvantage is that the PSE
occurs in the biggest and the most valuable muscle groups such as

m. longissimus dorsi, m. semimembranosus, m. semitendinosus and m.
gluteus medius. The muscles of neck, shoulder and knuckle are less
vulnerable. The fat cuts of half-carcass (belly, dewlap and groin) are
not affected by PSE.
Some authors (Barbut et al., 2008; Channon, Payne, & Warner,
2000; Gajana, Nkukwana, Marume, & Muchenje, 2013; Gregory,
2010) claim that the animal breeders and meat processors should
give a special attention to the defect elimination through selective
breeding and control of environmental factors inuencing the meat
quality. However, in the foreseeable future it is rather unlikely to
eradicate major meat defects, including PSE, using zootechnical
methods. Thus, it is important to identify these defects, classify the
raw material and determine its end-use (as a raw material for
processing or culinary purposes) what, will result in its more
rational utilization. Unfortunately, unambiguous identication of
PSE and other meat defects is extremely difcult. In industrial
practice the meat quality evaluation is performed either visually
being encumbered with numerous errors or by means of apertures
measuring the following attributes: pH, EC and color lightness
(Brewer, Novakofski, & Freise, 2006; Warris, Brown, & Pasciak,
2006). The above-mentioned instrumental analyzes are the ex-
amples of
contact methods, which may result
in cross-
contamination of the meat and besides it is difcult to use them
directly on the meat dressing and fabrication line (Papadakis,
Abdul-Malek, Kamdem, & Yam, 2000).
One of the proposed methods in rapid on-line evaluation of
meat quality is the computer vision system (CVS). This method has
been successfully used in industrial practice to classify and assess
the meatiness of large animal carcasses and to classify the poultry
carcasses (Craigie et al., 2012; Fortin et al., 2003; Pabiou et al., 2011).
The research has been undertaken to check the possibility of the
CVS employment to evaluate the meat quality and many works
have been written on beef (Jackman, Sun, Allen, Brandon, & White,
2010; Sadkowski et al., 2014) and pork meat (Faucitano, Huff,
Teuscher, Gariepy, & Wegner, 2005) marbling. Recently, the tech-
nology based on the image analysis involves tracking the elements
on the meat dressing and fabrication line (Larsen, Hviid, Jrgensen,
Larsen, & Dahl, 2014). According to Girolami, Napolitano, Faraone,
and Braghieri (2013) it is possible to use the CVS to evaluate the
meat color parameters. In addition to being rapid and objective, this
method can be used on-line directly on the meat dressing and
fabrication line. Moreover, this technique is non-invasive and, as a
consequence, does not pose a health hazard for the consumers
(Papadakis et al., 2000; Salda ~na, Siche, Castro, Huaman, & Quevedo,
2014; Trinderup, Dahl, Jensen, Carstensen, & Conradsen, 2015).
The aim of this study was to determine the applicability of the
CVS method to detect the m. longissimus lumborum defect in in-
dustrial settings. Additionally, the accuracy of raw material classi-
cation into quality groups by means of
this method was
determined.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Research material and organization

The sampling material comprised 230 longissimus lumborum
(LL) muscles dissected from 230 different right swine half-
carcasses.
The animal slaughtering was conducted in industrial environ-
ment using a two step-chilling process (1st ambient temperature:
 10  C, time 1e2 h, 2nd ambient temperature: 0e4  C, time
approx. 22 h, to reach an internal temperature no higher than 4  C
in the muscle). The samples were obtained in 9 batches on 9 various
slaughter days. For the analysis the longest muscle was selected as
it is one of the biggest and most histologically homogenous muscle
of the pork carcass (it constitutes 10% of the carcass weight). Most
works on the PSE meat concern this type of muscle owing to its
high susceptibility to wateriness
and color
changeability
(Karamucki, Jakubowska, Rybarczyk, & Gardzielewska, 2013).
At 45-min post-mortem the pH1 of the raw material was
determined at the area of thoracic vertebra. At the same location
electric conductivity (EC1) was determined at 90-min post-mortem.
After the half-carcasses had been cooled for 24 h the pH2 and EC2
measurements were retaken at the same location. Then the muscle
with a bone was dissected from half-carcasses between 1st and 4th
lumbar vertebra (weighing 1000 g) and, then, the EC3 was
measured. Directly after that, using the CIEL*a*b* coordinates and
the CVS method, the color of muscles on a freshly cut surface (after
20 min blooming time) dissected from the lumbar side was deter-
mined. The raw material classication into quality groups was
conducted on the basis of pH1 and pH2 readings using the following
criteria: RFN (normal meat) pH1 > 5.8, pH2 5.5e6.0; PSE (exudative
meat) pH1  5.8, pH2  5.5; DFD pH1 > 6.0, pH2 > 6.0, RSE pH1 > 5.8,
pH2  5.5 (Pospiech, Iwanowska, & Montowska, 2011).
At 48 h post-mortem, in order to give more precise character-
ization of the raw material, the selected parameters of its techno-
logical quality were determined proving the defect or not. To do so,
from each sample a slice was cut off (weighing around 100 g,
boneless) used for the determination of
the drip loss. The
remaining part of raw material was deboned and then comminuted

in the meat mincer (Diana 886.8, Zelmer, Rzeszow, Poland)
equipped with  3 mm plate and the water holding capacity (WHC)
and thermal drip was measured. The raw material was also
described in terms of total heme pigments and the content of basic
chemical components (water, total protein, collagen and fat). The
captured photos of the analyzed pork muscles underwent image
analysis.

2.2. Methods

2.2.1. The pH measurement
The pH values were measured by inserting a spearhead elec-
trode and a temperature sensor of pH-meter CP-411 (Elmetron,
Zabrze, Poland) directly into the analyzed raw material. The device
was calibrated with two buffers (pH 4 and 7). All measurements
were analyzed in triplicates from which an average was calculated.

2.2.2. Electrical conductivity (EC) measurement
The electrical conductivity (EC) was measured using Pork
Quality Meter (PQM MT-03, Zakad Techniki Mikroprocesorowej
EXE, Poznan, Poland) by inserting its probe into the muscle cross-
wise to the myocytes. The device was calibrated using a 5 and
20 mS measurement standard provided by the producer (which
also provided a PQM).

2.2.3. CIEL*a*b* measurements
The CIEL*a*b* coordinates were determined using a Konica
Minolta CM2600d spectrophotometer (Minolta, Wrocaw, Poland).
The following settings were chosen: illuminant D65, observer 10 ,
aperture 8 mm, calibrated with a white plate (L* 99.18, a* 0.07,
b* 0.05). The measurements were taken on a freshly cut surface of
the analyzed muscle samples of the loin after 20-min bloom time at
4e6  C. All measurements were analyzed in quintuplicate from
which an average was calculated. Using a Konica Minolta apparatus
the parameters of C* (Chroma) and h (hue angle) were calculated
based on the a* and b* values.

2.2.4.
Image capture and analysis
The photos of the meat samples were taken in accordance with
the procedure described by Chmiel, Sowi nski, and Dasiewicz
(2011) and Chmiel, Sowinski, Dasiewicz, and Florowski (2012).
Briey, after 20 min of blooming, the samples were placed in front
of a black background at a measurement station and images were
taken. Standard conditions for obtaining images were provided:
halogen lighting (4 matt bulbs, 18 W each, color temperature of
2800 K, color rendering index of 90e100). Images were obtained
using the following camera CANON EOS 350D with an EF-S 60-mm
macro lens digital camera (Canon, USA), connected to the com-
puter, vertical position at 500 mm distance between the lens and
meat surface and an angle of 45 with the light source. Camera
settings were as follow: manual mode with the f/4.0 aperture value,
image exposure time 1/100 and ISO 200, zoom and ash off. Images
were saved in RAW format. Then, the white balance was corrected
and a color prole was selected (Adobe RGB) using Canon Utilities
ZoomBrowser EX 5.6 (version 5.6.0.27; Canon).
The processed images were saved in TIFF format and analyzed
using Image Analyzer software (developed for the Division of Meat
Technology, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Warsaw, Poland).
The detailed operation of this software has been previously
described (Chmiel et al., 2011). Information regarding the color and
lightness of each particular pixel was acquired from images. The
software calculated the average color components of the meat sli-
ces for RGB (red, green, blue), HSV (hue, saturation, value), and HSL
(hue, saturation, lightness) models.

2.2.5. Drip loss evaluation
Each slice (weighing approx. 100 g) was weighed and sealed in a
polyethylene bag. The samples were stored at 4e6  C for 24 h.
Following this, the bags were opened, the exudative moisture was
decanted and the samples were reweighed. The amount of
exudation was expressed as a percent of the original weight and the
following formula was tted:
drip loss  [(weight before   weight after cooling storage) ¡Â weight
before cooling storage]  100%

2.2.6. Water holding capacity (WHC)
Water holding capacity was determined according to Grau and
Hamm (1952) method in modication by Pohja and Niinivaara
(1957). A 0.3 g sample of meat placed on a lter paper (Whatman
1) was put between two glass plates and loaded (2 kg). After 5 min,
the surface areas occupied by meat and muscle juice was deter-
mined. Results were presented as the area of the pressed muscle
juice reduced by the surface occupied by meat, and expressed as
area size per 1 g of raw material (cm2/g). The higher WHC value, the
worse water holding capacity of meat.

2.2.7. Thermal drip
Thermal drip was determined according to Miazek and Mroczek
(2013). Samples of 30 g (¡À0.1 g) of grinded meat were weighed into
beakers (150 cm3). Meat was pressed at the bottom of the beaker
and covered with foil. Heat treatment was conducted in a water
bath with a temperature of 70 C (¡À2 C) for 30 min. The samples
were cooled in air for 20 min to a temperature of 20  C, the drip
(liquid fraction) was decanted and the sample weight was
measured again. The thermal drip was determined according to the
formula: TD  (a b)/(a c)  100%, where TD e thermal drip (%); a
e weight of beaker with the sample before heat treatment (g); b e
weight of beaker with the sample after heat treatment, after
decanting the drip (g); and c e weight of empty beaker (g).

2.2.8. Total heme pigment content
The total heme pigments content was measured according to a
method described by Hornsey (1956). The extraction of pigments
was
performed
using
acetone
acid
solution
(acetone:HClconcentr  40:3). Previously thermically processed 5 g
sample of comminuted meat, was weighed (with 0.01 g precision)
and then placed into bottles made of dark glass. Following this,
21.5 cm3 acidied acetone solution was added in two phases: 5 cm3
(mixed in order to achieve homogenous consistency), and then the
remaining solution (16.5 cm3). The whole mixture was stirred for
3 min and, after that, it was left to cool down for 30 min in darkness.
Next, the extract was ltered through a drain and the absorbance
was measured with a HITACH-U-1100 (Hitachi Corporation, Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) spectrophotometer using a wave length of 640 nm in
relation to a reagent blank. This reagent blank was produced by
decanting 21.5 cm3 acetone acid solution into a laboratory ask
with 25 cm3 volume, which was relled with distilled water up to
the mark. The total pigment content was calculated using the
following formula: X  A640*680, where:, X e content of total
heme pigments (hemin ppm), A640 e value of ltrate absorbance at
640 nm wave length.

2.2.9. Basic chemical composition
The basic chemical composition was determined using a
FoodScan meat analyzer (FOSS Denmark) according to PN-A-
82109:2010 (PCS, 2010).

2.2.10. Statistical analysis
The obtained results were analyzed statistically by subjecting all
the data to analysis of variance (One-Way ANOVA). Signicant
differences between features were veried by HSD Tukey¡¯s test at a
signicance level of a  0.05. The accuracy of the raw material
classication was veried using discriminant analysis. The quality
classication was tested by means of cross-validation using K-fold
for K  1 (i.e. using leave-one-out method, Lachenbruch & Mickey,
1968; Krzanowski, 2005). The dependencies between the analyzed
parameters were calculated using Pearson (linear) correlation.
Owing to numerous dependencies, their linearity was investigated
using Kozak and Wnuk (2011) method. The correlation was
described using, inter alia, so called correlogram, i.e., graphical
display of correlation matrix developed by Friendly (2002). To
make the correlation analysis easier, the order of parameters in the
matrix was established using hierarchical clustering.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Classication and characterization of raw material quality - the
pH-based classication

Out of 230 pork m. longissimus lumborum (LL) samples, 104 were
classied as RFN, 102 as PSE and 24 did not satisfy the classication
criteria for the given two quality groups. For the above-mentioned
24 samples the pace of post-mortem changes and the pace of pH
drop was characteristic neither of RFN meat nor of PSE meat. In
spite of an initial high pH1 (>5.8), the pace of pH decrease in 11
samples was slow whilst 24 h post-mortem pH2 was still elevated
(>6.0). The samples were classied as DFD. The remaining 13
samples were also characterized by pH1 attributed to the meat of
normal quality however it dropped rapidly and 24 h after slaugh-
tering pH2 was 5.5 (characteristic of PSE meat). The samples were
classied as those belonging to RSE meat. As a result, the analyzed
raw material was divided into 4 quality groups 1. RFN, 2. PSE, 3. DFD
and 4. RSE.

3.2. The characterization of raw material quality

The m. longissimus lumborum classied as PSE was marked by a
signicantly (P  0.05) higher electrical conductivity EC1, EC2 and
EC3, when compared with the remaining quality groups (Table 1).
Similar
relationships were observed by Van de Perre and
Permentier (2010b). Only upon measuring the electrical conduc-
tivity on the muscles dissected from the carcass it was established
that the EC3 of the DFD meat was signicantly lower when
compared to the rest of meat quality groups (Table 1). The highest
correlation coefcients were determined between pH1, pH2 and EC3
of the analyzed meat (Fig. 1).
The PSE and RSE meat had considerably (P  0.05) more profuse
drip loss and thermal drip and deteriorated WHC when compared
to the RFN and DFD meat. The DFD meat had signicantly (P  0.05)
less drip loss and the best WHC (Table 1). Similar ndings were
reported by other authors (Di Luca, Mullen, Elia, Davey, & Hamill,
2011; Lee et al., 2012). Overabundant drip loss from the PSE meat
limits its commercial application for culinary purposes. Excessive
drip in a packaging is negatively perceived by the consumer. The
worsened WHC of PSE meat in comparison with RFN and DFD meat
was attributed to a low meat pH (close to isoelectric point (IP) of
muscle proteins). The closer IP of muscle proteins, the worse water
holding and binding capacity of meat. This dependency was
conrmed in the subsequent correlation analysis. The computed
correlation coefcients between pH1/pH2 and WHC were signi-
cantly high (Fig. 1).
The meat classied as PSE had signicantly lighter color

pigment content (Table 1). Additionally, a small amount of fat e
similar in all quality groups (approx. 4%, Table 1) - should not affect
the meat lightness. Additionally, the analyzed raw material from
different meat quality classes was characterized by similar water,
protein, and collagen content. As for the parameters of RGB model,
a concurrent increase in all three R, G, B parameters of PSE meat
was reported when compared with the values of these parameters
in normal meat (RFN). It leads to an increase in image lightness and,
the PSE meat color expressed through values of parameters deter-
mined by means of the CVS method was lighter than the normal
meat. Similarly, a concurrent proportional drop in the values of all
three color parameters of RGB model in the DFD meat was observed
when compared with the values of the color coordinates of the
normal meat (RFN) resulting in a drop of image lightness. The color
of the DFD meat expressed through the RGB parameters was
consequently darker than that of the RFN meat. The above-
mentioned dependencies were reected in the subsequent corre-
lation analysis (Fig. 1). The ndings obtained by many authors
indicated that there exist correlations between meat pH and the
lightness of its color. The PSE meat is lighter while the DFD is darker
than the RFN meat (Brewer et al., 2006; Warris et al., 2006).
No signicant differences in the lightness of RFN and RSE meat
color were discovered (Table 2). No signicant differences in means
of the remaining achromatic color components a* and b* were
found in DFD, RSE and RFN meat, whilst the PSE meat had signi-
cantly the highest values of these parameters (Table 2). The raw
material classied as PSE was marked by signicantly the highest
Chroma values determined both by means of CIEL*a*b* (C*) and the
CVS method (S parameter) whereas the hue angle values were the
lowest (h or H). The reverse dependency was observed in the DFD
meat (Table 2). The described dependencies were consistent with
the literature (Chmiel et al., 2011; Di Luca et al., 2011; Faucitano
et al., 2010).

3.3. Dependencies between quality and color parameters of meat

The next stage of the current study involved determination of
the dependency between the individual quality parameters of the
analyzed m. longissimus lumborum and, inter alia, color coordinates
determined by means of two methods. In order to do so, the cor-
relation analysis was conducted. Due to numerous dependencies,
their linearity was veried using the method developed by Kozak
and Wnuk (2011). The correlation was presented using correlo-
gram (Fig. 1) i.e., a graphic presentation of correlation matrix
(Friendly, 2002). The key accompanying the gure shows the colors
for the size of correlation (the positive dependencies were marked
blue whilst the negative ones with red). Besides, the size of the
point denotes the dependency strength e no linear dependency no
such a point. It was established that there is a negative linear de-
pendency between the pH of the analyzed LL (taken both at 45-min
and 24-h post-slaughter) and L* color coordinate determined by
means of CIEL*a*b* (Fig. 1, Table 3). The correlation and determi-
nation coefcients between pH and the color lightness L* were
higher for the pH measured at 24-h post-mortem than that of
45 min indicating to a closer connection between the analyzed
parameters. Over 50% of cases the color lightness was determined
by pH2. These ndings are in accordance with the dependencies
reported by Brewer et al. (2006), Warris et al. (2006) and Van De
Perre and Permentier, (2010b) .
The obtained correlation and determination coefcients be-
tween the meat pH1 and pH2 and the color coordinates determined
by means of the CVS method (R, G, B, V and L) were similar to those
ones computed for the color lightness determined in the CIEL*a*b*
scale (Table 3, Fig. 1). As a consequence, the color measurement
using reection method might be replaced with the CVS method.
Similar conclusions were made by Girolami et al. (2013). The results
showed that
the colorimeter did not generate coordinates

corresponding to the true color of meat. Instead, the CVS method
gave valid measurements that reproduced a color very similar to
the real one.
In our study, also in this case the correlation and determination
coefcients were higher for the pH taken at 24-h post-slaughter
(pH2). As for the R, G, B, V and L coordinates in more 50% the co-
lor lightness expressed by these coordinates was determined by
pH1 or pH2. Concerning the rest of color coordinates: a* and b*
(CIEL*a*b*) as well as H and S (CVS), the calculated correlation co-
efcients between these coordinates and the meat pH were lower
(Fig. 1). Higher than those obtained in the present studies corre-
lation and determination coefcients between the pH and the color
lightness determined by means of the CVS method were achieved
by Chmiel et al. (2012) in their research into the employment of
color coordinates determined by means of the CVS method to
detect the DFD m. semimembranosus beef meat. It might have been
attributed to a greater difference in the color of RFN and DFD beef
meat.
Summing up, the pH of the analyzed m. longissimus lumborum
was signicantly correlated with most color coordinates while the
highest correlation coefcients were obtained for the color light-
ness L* (CIEL*a*b*) and color coordinates characterizing the light-
ness (R, G, B, V and L) determined by means of the CVS method. Like
the coordinates determined in CIEL*a*b* scale, the color co-
ordinates determined by means of the CVS method might be used
for the detection of the PSE and DFD meat along with the pH
evaluation of the pork LL and the classication of raw material into
the quality groups (RFN, PSE and DFD).

3.4. The evaluation of classication accuracy of swine m.
longissimus lumborum (LL) into quality groups using the CVS
method

In order to evaluate the accuracy of the analyzed m. longissimus
lumborum into the quality groups based on the color coordinates
determined by means of the CVS method, the discrimination
analysis was performed. For comparison, an analogous analysis was
carried out for color coordinates determined in CIEL*a*b* scale. The
obtained results were presented in Table 4. The color coordinates of
RGB, HSV and HSL had similar discrimination strength of the
analyzed m. longissimus lumborum into quality groups. The classi-
cation accuracy for RGB, HSV and HSL models was 80.0, 80.9 and
81.7%, respectively (Table 4). The obtained results indicate that out
of 230 samples of m. longissimus lumborum 184e188 were correctly
classied into appropriate quality groups. As a comparison, the
classication accuracy based on the color coordinates determined
in the CIEL*a*b* scale was similar and reached 82.6%.

Using the color coordinates of RGB model, the classication
accuracy of the raw material into all quality groups was 80.0%, and
on per-quality groups basis: 84% samples (87 items) were correctly
classied as RFN meat whereas 16% (14 items as PSE and 3 items as
DFD) were misclassied (Table 4). 89% of samples (91 items) were
correctly classied as PSE whilst 11% of samples were incorrectly
classied as RFN meat. As for the RSE meat, no sample was classi-
ed (correctly or not) into this quality group, out of 13, almost all of
them (12) were classied as the normal meat. The classication
accuracy of raw material into the DFD group was 82% while 18% (2
samples) were misclassied as the RFN meat (Table 4).
Using the color coordinates of HSV model, 80.9% of m. long-
issimus lumborum was classied correctly into appropriate quality
groups, and on per-quality groups basis: 18% of RFN meat samples
were misclassied (14 items as PSE and 5 as DFD). Regarding the
PSE meat, the classication accuracy of the raw material was 91%
with 9% being misclassied as RFN meat.
The classication accuracy of the raw material into appropriate
quality groups using the color coordinates of the HSL model was
81.7%. On per-quality group basis: 84% of samples (87 items) were

correctly classied as RFN meat whereas 16% was misclassied as
PSE and DFD (13 and 4 samples, respectively). Like the color co-
ordinates of HSV model, the classication accuracy for PSE meat
based on the model HSL parameters was 91%, whereas 9% was
incorrectly classied as RFN. Once more, no sample was classied
(correctly or not) as RSE quality group and of 13 samples, 12 were
classied as RFN meat and 1 as PSE meat. Out of 11 DFD samples 8
were correctly classied and 3 of them were misclassied as RFN
meat (Table 4).
In comparison, the classication accuracy of the raw material
based on the color coordinates determined in the CIEL*a*b* scale
was 82.6%. Again for this color model, no sample was classied
(correctly or not) as RSE meat and all the samples were incorrectly
classied as RFN meat. All the DFD samples were correctly classied
whilst the accuracy for RFN and PSE classication was 88 and 82%,
respectively. 12 RFN meat samples were misclassied as PSE while
18 RFN samples were incorrectly classied as PSE (Table 4).
Chmiel et al. (2012) achieved higher classication accuracy of
the CVS for RFN and DFD beef m. semimembranosus. As for the color
coordinate L* (CIEL*a*b*), 91.8% of the analyzed samples were
correctly classied into appropriate meat quality groups. And as far
as the coordinates V and L (CVS) were concerned, the classication
accuracy was also high and reached 90.0 and 88.4%, respectively.
The obtained higher accuracy of raw material classication into
individual beef meat quality groups might have been caused by
bigger differences in the color of RFN and DFD meat. In the studies
of Zapotoczny, Szczypi nski, and Daszkiewicz (2016) a method for
evaluating the quality of medium-ground and nely-ground cold
meats with the use of computer-assisted image analysis was
developed. Statistical model used by authors discriminated cold
meats with 89e100% accuracy, subject to product type. Also in the
studies undertaken by Sun et al. (2016), the accuracy of CVS method
was investigated. Eighteen color features were extracted from three
different color spaces (RGB, HSI and L*a*b*) and were shown to
have useful
information regarding pork color. L*, a*, and b*
extracted from images were signicantly correlated with Minolta
colorimeter L*, a*, and b*, respectively. Additionally, a favorable
coefcient of determination (R2  0.82) was achieved when using
the linear regression method for predicting pork color score.

4. Conclusions

It may be inferred that there exists possibility of the CVS
employment in detection of PSE and DFD m. longissimus lumborum
as well as their classication into the quality groups. The accuracy
of raw material classication was 80.0% for the RGB model and
80.9% for the HSV model and 81.7% for the HSL model. This was
similar to the classication accuracy based on the color coordinates
in the CIEL*a*b* scale and reached 82.6%. Consequently, the CVS
method can be used for a rapid quality evaluation of porcine m.
longissiumus lumborum. One advantage of the CVS method is the
fact that it gives the possibility to analyze the color of the whole
meat surface in a non-invasive and on-line way while the area
measured by means of a colorimeter or a spectrophotometer covers
only the area of measurement head. In addition, this is a contact
method and has to be used periodically. The implementation of the
CVS into the industrial practice will allow evaluating the culinary
and processing quality of the meat with a great accuracy and in this
way will show an appropriate direction of its employment. The
right selection of raw material and its optimal utilization will, in
consequence, ensure the quality standardization and high con-
sumer acceptability for the products. Thus, both producers and
consumers will benet. This is especially important now when
meat processing plants are competing for markets.
