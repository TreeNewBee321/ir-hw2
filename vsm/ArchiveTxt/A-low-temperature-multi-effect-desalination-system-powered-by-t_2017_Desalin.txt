abstract

This paper introduces a medium-size low-temperature multi-effect desalination (LT-MED) system. Powered by
the cooling water of a 1000 kW diesel power generator set, the system can produce 60 tons of fresh water per
day. First, the thermodynamic and heat transfer model of the LT-MED system is derived. Second, an integrated
four-effect tower distiller is designed and built. The system is installed in the Guishan Island, Zhuhai, Guangdong,
China, and tested comprehensively. In the operation, the evaporation temperature of each effect is linearly pro-
portional to the heat load of the power generator. Additionally, the evaporation temperature in each effect distill-
er rose linearly when the heat load was gradually increased. The variation of evaporation pressure was consistent
with the evaporation temperature. When the heat load of the power generator increases from 300 kW to 530 kW,
the fresh water production rate increases from 1.26 m3/h to 2.30 m3/h. The conductivity of the fresh water is usu-
ally b 100 ¶ÃS/cm. Because of electricity and freshwater co-production, the system is environmental friendly and is
particularly useful for islands and offshore platforms.

1. Introduction

With the rapid growth of the global population and the improve-
ment of living standards, the demand for freshwater has increased dra-
matically in the past few decades. As a result, global water scarcity has
become a critical problem [1®C2]. To solve this problem, desalination is
a key technology. In the past 50®C60 years, desalination industry has
grown dramatically [3®C4]. However, there is a crucial problem: high en-
ergy consumption. In general, desalination processes can be divided
into two main categories based on the phase change of seawater [5®C
8]. The rst category refers to thermal processes including Multi-Stage
Flash distillation (MSF), Multi-Effect Distillation (MED), Thermal
Vapor Compression (TVC), and Mechanical Vapor Compression
(MVC). The second category is based membrane ltration including re-
verse osmosis (RO), and electro-dialysis (ED). From the energy point of
view, all these desalination processes are energy thirsty [9®C11]. In par-
ticularly, the membrane process would have a higher overall efciency
at the expense of consuming a large amount of electricity. The greatest
advantage of the thermal processes is that they can use any types of
thermal sources consuming very little electricity. As a result, it is partic-
ularly useful when renewable energy, such as solar, geothermal, as well
as waste heat, such as streams and/or hot water from power generation
and other chemical engineering processes, is available. In short, it has
been agreed that the desalination process shall use renewable energy
or waste energy that is low cost or even cost free [12®C15].
Waste thermal energy is very common in the process industry, and
waste heat management is an important consideration as it affects oper-
ation cost and system performance. In general, waste heat can be

divided into two kinds: high grade and low grade. The high grade refers
to those that have temperature above 80 °„C and can be easily recovered
using conventional methods, while low grade refers to those that have
temperature below 80 °„C and is often not economically viable to recover

[16®C17]. In practice, low grade waste heat would be one of the most
promising options for desalination [18®C19]. It matches well with the re-
quirement of MED, in which higher temperature should be avoided to
prevent the precipitation of gypsum that could severely foul the heat
exchanger [20®C21].
Diesel generator set consisting of engine, generator and control sys-
tem, is widely used in the region far away from power grid such as
islands and offshore platforms. However, it can only convert about
40% of the energy from fuel combustion into useful work, and the re-
maining energy is discharged into environment in the form of waste
heat, which includes 30% in the exhaust gas, 25% in the jacket cooling
water, and 5% of other heat losses [22]. Thus, utilizing the waste heat
from diesel engine for desalination would be ideal [23®C25]. This moti-
vates us to design and build a 60 Ton per day (T/day) LT-MED desalina-
tion system powered by a 1000 kW diesel generator set.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the
design of the desalination system. Section 3 gives its thermodynamic
model. Section 4 describes the building of the system and the experi-
ment results. Finally, Section 5 contains conclusions and discussions.

2. Pilot plant description

2.1. Design conditions

The desalination process was designed based on the waste heat re-
source and the quality of raw seawater. The cooling water waste heat
of a diesel engine with a rated power of 1000 kW was used as the
heat sources of the MED desalination process, and the related parame-
ters of the diesel engine were listed in Table 1. The temperature range
of cooling water produced in the diesel engine is usually between 71
and 85 °„C, which matches extremely well with the multi-effect distilla-
tion (MED) technology. Considering the heat dissipation and uctuating
electric load, the waste heat load of cooling water recovered from the
diesel engine was set as 600 kW. Besides, the quality of raw seawater
was also tested before designing the system, which is listed in Table 2
and a simple pretreatment process will be sufcient for MED
technology.

2.2. Process description

The schematic diagram of our LT-MED seawater desalination process
driven by cooling water waste heat from a diesel generator set is shown
in Fig. 1. It consists of a hot water circuiting system, four evaporators, a
condenser, a vacuum system and other auxiliary equipment. In the four-
effect distiller, each effect contains heat exchanging tubes, vapor space,
brine spray nozzles and a demister. The horizontal falling lm evapora-
tor is preferred to use in the MED processes for getting high heat trans-
fer efciency [26®C27].
As shown in the gure, after being ltered by a simple meshed grid
the seawater is pumped into the tubes of the condenser. A large portion
of the seawater is rejected back to the sea as cooling water, while the
remnant ows into the preheater through a self-cleaning lter. Then,
the preheated water enters the rst effect distiller starting the multi-ef-
fect desalination process. At the meantime, the circulating hot water

receives the heat from the cooling water of the diesel engine and pumps
into the rst effect distiller as heating medium to transfer the heat ener-
gy to the feed seawater, and ows into the preheater to preheat the
feed.
This forward feed conguration is adopted for its simplicity and op-
eration efcient [28]. The entire low-temperature evaporation process
is operated under low pressure condition generated by a vacuum
pump. Both the brine and the vapor ow from the rst effect to the
last effect. At the rst effect distiller, the feed seawater is heated up to
its boiling temperature and a portion of it evaporates subsequently.
The generated vapor goes through demister and then ows into the sec-
ond effect distiller to be condensed. In the second effect distiller, the
condensation and the evaporation occurs at the same time. This permits
the feed seawater to undergo multiple boiling without additional
heating. This process is repeated likewise in the third and the fourth ef-
fect distillers. Finally, the generated vapor in the last effect distiller is
condensed in the condenser. The condensed freshwater from each effect

distiller is pumped into a storage tank and the brine is pumped back to
the sea.

3. Mathematical model

3.1. Modeling assumption

In this section, the mathematical model of mass balance and energy
balance for the preheater, the evaporators and the condenser are pre-
sented. In the model, following assumptions are made:

 The startup and shutdown conditions are not considered, so the pro-
cess is assumed to be at steady state and the parameters do not de-
pend on time.
 Concentration of feed seawater is known based on sample analysis,
and the concentration of salt in distillate stream is negligible, so distil-
late product is assumed to be salt free.
 Since all effects follow almost the same structural design, temperature
difference between each two adjacent effects is taken to be identical.
 The outer side walls of preheater, evaporators and condenser are insu-
lated, heat losses to the surrounding are assumed to be negligible.
 Pressure drop in the demister as well as during the vapor condensa-
tion process is neglected.
 The effect of fouling factors and the presence of non-condensable gas-
ses on the heat transfer coefcients in the evaporators, preheaters and
the condenser are neglected.

3.2. Thermodynamic calculation model

A schematic of main four-effect desalination plant's parts is shown in

3.3. Heat transfer model

Based on the above thermodynamic state parameters, heat transfer
coefcients of every effect distiller are described by the following equa-
tions [30®C32], and the detailed structural parameters can be determined
by heat transfer calculation. Specically, internal convection and exter-
nal falling lm evaporation happen in rst effect, internal condensation
and external falling lm evaporation occur from the second to the
fourth effect, and internal convection and external condensation hap-
pen in the condenser.

Based on the design conditions and parameters given above as well
as the MED mathematical model of thermodynamics and heat transfer
calculation, the actual heat exchange area and the tube bundle arrange-
ment in each effect distiller are obtained by the layout design of struc-
ture. The detailed structure parameters of the desalination plant are
listed in Table 4.
In order to provide compact and integrated desalination equipment
for usage on islands and offshore platforms, an integrated four-effect
tower distiller was designed (Fig. 4). Heat transfer tubes (i.d./o.d. 17/
19 mm) were made of stainless steel 316L, with the effective length of
1.95 m, and the total number of heat exchanging tubes was up to
1500.
The
overall
size
of
the
four-effect
distiller was
2.5 m °¡ 2.0 m °¡ 4.0 m (length °¡ width °¡ height) and the total weight
was about 5.6 tons. The liquid distributors consisting of runoff tubes
and liquid distributing salvers was designed to distribute liquid lm
uniformly on the heat exchanging tube bundles. Besides, multi-stage
bafes were used as demisters.

4. Auxiliary equipment and measuring apparatus

According to the thermodynamic parameters of the desalination sys-
tem, some auxiliary equipments were selected to build the pilot plant.
On the basis of the local seawater quality, terrain, and ocean currents,
coastal seawater intake system was chosen, and a submersible pump
with a grille was selected to delivery raw seawater. The self-cleaning

lter (ltration precision °‹ 100 ¶Ãm) was adopted to further lter seawa-
ter. Water-ring vacuum pump was used to keep the pressure of the dis-
tillation process at a low level (with an extreme pressure of 3.3 kPa).
Resistance thermometers, pressure sensors, and orice plate ow
meters were used to measure temperature, pressure, and ow rate in
the pilot plant respectively. Specially, sea water spray temperature
and generated vapor pressure in each effect distiller must be measured
in order to compare with the data in listed in Table 3. The quality of
water product was monitored by an online conductivity meter installed
at outlet of the product pump. Besides, off-line freshwater sample was
collected and detected based on the national drinking water criterion
[33]. Detailed information for auxiliary equipment and measuring appa-
ratus can be found in Table 5. All of the data shown during the working
process were recorded by the host computer automatically. Detailed lo-
cation distribution and numbering order of the measurement points can
be seen in Fig. 1.

5. Operating performance of demonstration system

5.1. Pilot plant

The high production (60T/d) desalination pilot plant driven by
cooling water waste heat of the diesel engine has been established
and successfully operated since early 2015. Fig. 5 shows the photo of
pilot device. The diesel generator set combines with the desalination
pilot plant provides an electricity and water co-production for residents
of Guishan Island.

5.2. Startup procedure

It is important to startup the desalination plant quickly and econom-
ically. We usually start the pilot plant after the diesel generator set is

running, at which point the waste heat of cooling water starts to gener-
ate. When the diesel generator set runs and the cooling water tempera-
ture rises to about 65 °„C, the hot water circulation pump is started to
recover the waste heat. At the same time, the distiller is depressurized
to 5®C10 kPa by the water ring vacuum pump, and 20®C30 min are usually
needed to at this stage. And then, cooling water and the feed of seawater
will be pumped to the condenser and the distiller respectively. Fig. 6
shows the parameters at the startup stage of the pilot plant.
The running diesel engine provides heat sources for the desalination
system. The total heat load recovered by the pilot plant can be calculat-
ed by Eqs. (3), (9), and (14). It can be seen from Fig. 6a that Th,in,1, Th,out,1
and Th,out,0 decline quickly rst when the feed of seawater are injected
into the distiller, which shows that heat has been transferred from the
circulating hot water to the seawater. Then Th,in,1, Th,out,1 and Th,out,0
rise and become stable gradually. As the feed evaporates and the
steam condenses, the differences of temperature and pressure among
the four effect distillers are established step by step (Fig.6b and c),
which shows that the pilot plant has been operated successfully.

5.3. Temperature and pressure distribution at steady-state condition

The inuence of heat load on evaporation temperature and pressure
in each effect distiller is shown in Fig.7a and b, with constant ow rates
of cooling seawater, feed seawater and circulating hot water. It can be
seen that the evaporation temperature of each effect almost increases
linearly when the heat load was gradually increased. This is due to the
increase in circulating hot water temperature with the increase in
heat load, which leads to the increase in evaporation temperatures in

the rst effect. And the evaporation temperature decreases gradually
from the rst effect to the last effect for throttle effect in the distiller.
Since evaporation temperature in each effect is saturated, the variation
of evaporation pressure is consistent with evaporation temperature.

5.4. Fresh water productivity and quality

Fig. 8 shows the effect of the heat load on freshwater production rate
and conductivity. It can be seen that the water production rate will in-
crease with increasing heat load. The designed heat load and water pro-
ductivity of the desalination system are 600 kW and 2.84 m3/h
respectively. The heat load of the desalination system usually ranges
from 300 kW to 530 kW, which corresponds to the operating power
of the generator. Due to the limited power consumption of the resi-
dents, the quantity of heat is usually lower than full load. Thus, the
heat transfer area of the distiller is sufcient in the insufcient heat
load conditions and water productivity depends on the total heat load
[34®C35]. Under the operating conditions, water production rate is
1.26 m3/h at heat load of 310 kW. When the heat load of desalination
system increases to 530 kW, water production rate increases to
2.30 m3/h. And the fresh water production may further increase when
the heat load increases.
The distillation process can remove most of the salt in seawater, thus
reducing the conductivity. The conductivity of seawater feed is usually
kept as a constant, so desalination efciency can be acquired by measur-
ing conductivity of the fresh water. The power of the diesel generator is
unstable because of the uctuation in electricity consumption, which
makes heat load unstable. Thus, the fresh water conductivity uctuates

frequently. Considering the bafe demisters used in LT-MED system, an
optimal vapor mass ow rate corresponding to the best working ef-
ciency may exist [36®C37]. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that the conductivity
of fresh water uctuates strongly due to uctuation of vapor mass
ow rate. Even so, the conductivity of desalted water is b 100 ¶ÃS/cm in
most operating conditions.
Moreover, based on the third party testing result, the quality of the
freshwater samples can be seen in Table 6. It meets the standard of
the Chinese national drinking water act [33].

6. Conclusion

This paper presents a 60 Ton per day (T/d) low-temperature multi-
effect distillation (LT-MED) desalination system driven by the cooling
water waste of a 1000 kW diesel engine power generator. The system
combines the diesel generator set forms an electricity-water coproduc-
tion plant, which can provide both electricity and freshwater for the

residents of Guishan Island, Zhuhai, China. Based on the discussions
above, following conclusions can be drawn:

(1) The performance of the system can be well predicted by the pre-
sented thermodynamic model.
(2) In the steady state operating condition, the evaporation temper-
ature of each effect is proportional to the amount of heat load.
The evaporation temperature decreases gradually from the rst
effect to the last effect. Besides, the variation of evaporation pres-
sure is correlated to the evaporation temperature.
(3) The water production increases from 1.26 m3/h to 2.30 m3/h
when the heat load is increased from 300 kW to 530 kW. The
conductivity of the freshwater uctuates due to the uctuation
of vapor mass ow rate, but is b 100 ¶ÃS/cm in most operating
conditions. Moreover, based on the test of a third party company,
the freshwater meet the standard of the Chinese national drink-
ing water act and is very safe to drink.
