abstract

Detection of weak maneuvering target often suffers from the problems of the range migration (RM) and 
the Doppler frequency migration (DFM) within the coherent pulse interval. In order to eliminate the RM 
and DFM, a new coherent integration method based on keystone transform (KT) and matched ltering 
process (MFP), i.e., KT-MFP, is proposed. Specically, this method rstly corrects the linear RM caused 
by the unambiguous velocity via KT and then the MFP, which jointly searching in the fold factor and 
acceleration domain, is carried out to remove the residual RM and compensate the DFM. At last, coherent 
integration of the target＊s energy is achieved through the slow time Fourier transform (FT). The advantage 
of the proposed method is that it can obtain superior coherent integration and detection performance for 
both the slow-moving and fast-moving target, in comparison with the existing algorithms. In addition, 
KT-MFP could avoid the blind speed sidelobe (BSSL) effect. Numerical simulations are performed to assess 
the performance from different aspects, i.e., computational complexity, coherent integration for a low- 
speed target, detection performance for a low-speed target, coherent integration for a high-speed target, 
detection performance for a high-speed target and coherent integration for multi-targets.

1. Introduction 

With the great progress of science and technology, maneuver- 
ing target detection has drawn more and more attention in mod- 
ern radar eld [1每9] . In general, there exists the problem of the 
weak radar returns because of the low radar cross section (RCS) 
of the maneuvering targets, which may make the detection more 
dicult [10每13] . Increasing the integration time can improve the 
detection performance effectively with the help of coherent inte- 
gration technique [14,15] . Unfortunately, the conventional detection 
method, e.g. moving target detection (MTD) algorithm, might be 
confronted with a performance loss because of the range migra- 
tion (RM) and the Doppler frequency migration (DFM) caused by 
the complex motions (i.e., velocity and acceleration) of maneuver- 
ing targets during the long coherent integration time [16每21] . In 
order to solve the problems of RM and DFM, several methods are 
introduced as follows. 
The keystone transform (KT), which can eliminate the linear RM 
effectively through rescaling the time axis, is one of the most pop- 
ular methods [22每25] . Radon Fourier transform (RFT) is another 
method which can integrate the energy via searching along the di- 
rections of range and velocity [26,27] . However, the coherent in- 
tegration methods mentioned above may suffer a serious perfor- 
mance loss as long as the DFM effect appears. 
In order to compensate the DFM and achieve the coherent in- 
tegration, an ecient method based on KT and fractional Fourier 
transform (FRFT), i.e., KT-FRFT, was proposed [28] . Another method 
combining the improved axis rotation (IAR) and FRFT, named as 
IAR-FRFT, was employed to realize the coherent integration for the 
target with a constant acceleration [29] . The KT-FRFT or IAR-FRFT 
could correct the linear RM induced by the target＊s velocity via 
KT or IAR. After that, the DFM compensation and coherent inte- 
gration can be obtained by FRFT. Nevertheless, these two methods 
could not correct the quadratic RM caused by the target＊s accel- 
eration which would lead to a performance loss. The generalized 
Radon Fourier transform (GRFT) was then presented to remove 
the quadratic RM and DFM and complete the coherent integration 
[26,30] . Particularly, GRFT can achieve the coherent integration by 
jointly searching along the target trajectory. Although GRFT could 
obtain a good detection performance, it often suffers a huge com- 
putational burden. Moreover, due to the discrete pulse sampling, 
limited range resolution and nite integration time [31] , the blind 
speed sidelobe (BSSL) effect would inevitably appear in the GRFT 
output, which might bring about severe false alarm and the detec- 
tion performance loss [30] . 
In this paper, for the sake of removing the RM (including the 
linear RM and the quadratic RM) and DFM to achieve the coherent 
integration, a method based on KT and matched ltering process 
(MFP), i.e., KT-MFP, is presented. In particular, KT is performed to 
correct the linear RM induced by the unambiguous velocity at rst. 
Then, the MFP, via jointly searching in the fold factor and accel- 
eration domain, is conducted to eliminate the residual linear RM 
caused by the blind velocity as well as the quadratic RM and DFM 
effect resulted from the acceleration. In the end, the slow time 
Fourier transform (FT) is performed to achieve the coherent inte- 
gration. 
Generally speaking, the presented method can obtain not only 
the superior coherent integration but also the better detection per- 
formance both for the low-speed target and high-speed target, in 
compared with RFT, IAR-FRFT and KT-FRFT. Additionally, the KT- 
MFP method has lower computational complexity than GRFT and 
could avoid the BSSL effect. Eventually, numerical experiments are 
performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. 
In Section 2 , the signal model is established. Then the proposed 
coherent integration method, i.e., KT-MFP, is given in Section 3 . Be- 
sides, we analyze the coherent integration for multi-targets as well 
as the computational complexity of KT-MFP and GRFT in this sec- 
tion. In Section 4 , we evaluate the performance via several numer- 
ical experiments from several aspects, including coherent integra- 
tion for a low-speed target, detection performance for a low-speed 
target, coherent integration for a high-speed target, detection per- 
formance for a high-speed target and coherent integration for mul- 
tiple targets. At last, we make a conclusion in Section 5 . 

2. Signal model and problem formulation

In order to solve the problems of RM and DFM and obtain the 
coherent accumulation, KT-MFP is proposed in the following sec- 
tion. 

3. Coherent integration via KT-MFP 

In this section, the detailed processes of the proposed method, 
i.e., KT-MFP, are introduced. Furthermore, the coherent integration 
via the KT-MFP for the multi-targets is also analyzed. Finally, the 
KT-MFP method is also compared with GRFT in terms of the com- 
putational complexity. 

3.1. Keystone transform 

Firstly, apply KT, which is performed as t m 
new slow-time variable), to eliminate the linear range migration 
 t n domain as 
[22,23,25] . Then (8) can be represented in the f

Consider that the radar transmits a narrowband signal, the

and 
[43] . Thus (9) can be recast as

Through the second exponential term in (10) , it can be seen 
that the linear RM resulted from unambiguous velocity a 0 
has been 
corrected. However, the last two exponential terms indicate that 
the linear RM caused by the blind velocity and the quadratic RM 
induced by acceleration still exist. 

3.2. Matched ltering process 

To eliminate the residual RM and the DFM in (10) , we dene 
the matched ltering function as

When k

From (13) , one can see that the residual RM caused by the blind 
velocity and the acceleration can be removed. Besides, the DFM 
effect resulted from the acceleration could also be compensated. 
After the RM and DFM compensation via KT and MFP, applying the

Remark. Note that the KT is a linear transform and could simulta- 
neously correct the effect of the linear RM induced by the unam- 
biguous velocity. In addition, the MFP is also a linear procedure. 
Therefore, there is no cross-talk among the multi-targets. More- 
over, it should be pointed out that the KT-MFP method could ob- 
tain the coherent integration for multiple targets simultaneously 
when the scattering intensities of the targets are approximately 
equal. However, if the scattering intensities of different targets are 
strikingly different, the weak targets may be shadowed by the 
strong ones and the coherent integration will become dicult for 
the weak targets. Then, the CLEAN technique [44每46] could be ap- 
plied to eliminate the effect of the strong targets and highlight the 
weak ones. By this way, the coherent integration of the strong and 
weak targets can be achieved iteratively [44每46] . 

3.4. Computational complexity 

In what follows, we analyze the computational complexity of 
the major steps in GRFT [30] and the proposed method. As far as 
the arithmetic types, the complex multiplication and addition op- 
erations are presented. We dene the number of searching range 
cells, echo pulses, searching velocity, searching acceleration and 
searching fold factor as N,
 respectively. In terms 
of the KT-MFP method, the KT operation needs MN log 2

sary. While GRFT method needs MNN a 1

tively the parameters of the radar in Table 2 (for the low-speed 
target) and Table 3 (for the high-speed target), we can achieve the 
ration of the computational complexity between GRFT and KT-MFP 
(which varying with the pulse number), as shown in Fig. 2 . In par-

(a) Ratio for the low-speed target. (b) Ratio for the high-speed target. 

ticular, the computational complexity ratio for the low-speed tar- 
get is shown in Fig. 2 (a). We can see that the computational com- 
plexity ratio of GRFT to the proposed method is bigger than 8. As 
for the computational complexity ratio for the high-speed target in 
Fig. 2 (b), it is larger than 400. Overall, the computational complex- 
ity of KT-MFP is lower than the GRFT＊s. 

4. Numerical results 

To evaluate the eciency of the proposed coherent integration 
method, numerical simulations are provided in this section. In or- 
der to carry out the comparison experiment for a single target with 
low-speed or high-speed, several popular methods, i.e., RFT, IAR- 
FRFT, KT-FRFT and GRFT are presented. Moreover, the detection 
performance for the low-speed and high-speed target as well as 
the coherent integration for multi-targets are also evaluated here- 
inbelow. 

4.1. Coherent integration for a low-speed target 

We analyze the coherent integration for a single target with 
low-speed via KT-MFP in Fig. 3 at rst. Note that we use the radar 

parameters of Table 2 in this section. Suppose that the motion pa- 
rameters of the low-speed target as r 0 
 200 km 
 120 m 
and a 2 
 21 m 
 respectively. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) af- 
ter PC is 6 dB. Fig. 3 (a) shows the result after the PC, which indi- 
cates that serious RM occurs. After applying the KT, Fig. 3 (b) shows 
the jointly searching result of the fold factor and acceleration via 
MFP. Through the peak value, we can easily nd that the estimated 
acceleration is 21 m/s 
2 and the estimated fold factor is equivalent 
to 1. Besides, Fig. 3 (c) gives the unambiguous velocity estimation 
result which is related to f t n 
and the estimated value is 26.23 m/s. 
So it is easily to work out the estimated velocity as 119.98 m/s. 
Fig. 3 (d) shows the RM correction result with the estimated motion 
parameters and it could be seen that all the RM has been removed. 
After eliminating the effect of RM, the coherent integration result 
through KT-MFP is shown in Fig. 3 (e), from which we can nd that 
the energy is focused and integrated well. 
With the purpose of contrast, the coherent integration results of 
RFT, IAR-FRFT, KT-FRFT and GRFT are also given in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 (a)每
4 (d) show the integration results of the four methods above, re- 
spectively. In particular, Fig. 4 (a) gives the integration result of 
RFT and it cannot focus the energy at all because of the DFM in- 
duced by target＊s acceleration. Fig. 4 (b) and 4 (c) show respectively 
the integration results of IAR-FRFT and KT-FRFT. We can see that 
although the target＊s energy is still accumulated, the integration 
performance of IAR-FRFT or KT-FRFT will decrease because of the 
quadratic RM, which will result in detection performance loss com- 
pared with KT-MFP (as shown in Section 4.2 ). Besides, Fig. 4 (d) 
gives the integration result of GRFT which can achieve the co- 
herent integration of target＊s energy. However, the computational 
complexity of GRFT is larger than the KT-MFP＊s.

4.2. Detection performance for a low-speed target 

In this section, we compare the detection performance of RFT, 
IAR-FRFT, KT-FRFT, GRFT and the proposed method for a low-speed 
target via the Monte Carlo trials. It is necessary to note that we 
make use of the radar parameters in Table 2 and the same mo- 
tion parameters in Fig. 3 . Subsequently, we set the false alarm 
4 and all echoes are submerged in Gaus- 
probability as P f a 
 10 
sian noises [47,48] . Fig. 5 shows the detection probabilities of the 
above-mentioned methods in different SNRs. The SNRs vary from 
20 dB to 20 dB. It is clearly that the detection performance of the 
proposed method precedes KT-FRFT, IAR-FRFT and RFT. Because of 
the sinc-like interpolation of the KT, the proposed method suffers 
slight performance loss, in comparison with GRFT. However, KT- 
MFP requires lower computational cost than GRFT.

4.3. Coherent integration for a high-speed target 

In the following simulation, we assess the coherent integration 
for a high-speed target via the proposed method in Fig. 6 . The 
simulation parameters of radar in this section is listed in Table 3 . 
The motion parameters of the high-speed target are r 0 
 500 km 
 30 0 0 
 310 m 
2 . Here we also set the SNR af- 
ter PC as 6 dB. According to Fig. 6 (a), we could see that serious 
RM happens after the PC. Fig. 6 (b) shows the jointly searching re- 
sult of the fold factor and acceleration after applying KT and MFP. 
The peak value denotes that the estimated acceleration is equal 
to 310 m/s 
2 and the estimated fold factor is 10 0 0. Fig. 6 (c) gives 
the unambiguous velocity estimation result is 0.81 m/s. So the esti- 
mated velocity is equal to 30 0 0.81 m/s. Fig. 6 (d) shows that RM has 
been corrected using the estimated motion parameters. After elim- 
inating the effect of RM, the coherent integration result through 
KT-MFP is given in Fig. 6 (e) where the energy of the high-speed 
target is also integrated well.

Fig. 5. Detection probability of RFT, IAR-FRFT, KT-FRFT, GRFT and KT-MFP for a low- 
speed target. 

In order to make a comparison, the coherent integration perfor- 
mance of other popular methods, i.e., RFT, IAR-FRFT, KT-FRFT and 
GRFT, is also shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 (a)每 7 (d) show the integration 
results of the aforementioned methods, respectively. Specically, 
Fig. 7 (a) shows that RFT cannot accumulate the energy mainly be- 
cause of the DFM effect caused by target＊s acceleration. Moreover, 
Fig. 7 (b) and 7 (c) show respectively the integration results of IAR- 

FRFT and KT-FRFT. Because of target＊s high speed and the high 
radar carrier frequency, the undersampling along the slow time di- 
mension would occur and then the FRFT-based integration meth- 
ods (i.e., IAR-FRFT and KT-FRFT) will become invalid. Furthermore, 
Fig. 7 (d) gives the integration result of the GRFT method. Although 
GRFT also could obtain the coherent integration, there appears the 
BSSL effect in the GRFT output, which might bring about severe 
false alarm and reduce the multi-targets detection ability. 

4.4. Detection performance for a high-speed target 

=

We compare the detection performance of RFT, IAR-FRFT, KT- 
FRFT, GRFT and KT-MFP for a high-speed target in this simulation, 
where the Monte Carlo trials are performed. One should point out 
that we still use the radar parameters in Table 3 and the motion 
parameters are identical to those in Fig. 6 . The false alarm prob- 
4 and the Gaussian noises are added to

KT-MFP method with other four methods in different SNR cases. 
20 dB, 20 dB]. One could clearly see that 
The SNRs also vary in [ 
the detection performance of KT-MFP is far better than that of KT- 
FRFT, IAR-FRFT and RFT. In fact, the undersampling of the slow 
time might appear on account of target＊s high speed and radar＊s 
high carrier frequency, so IAR-FRFT and KT-FRFT would become in- 
valid and their detection performance decrease a lot. Although the 
detection performance of the proposed method declines slightly 
(still because of the sinc-like interpolation for KT) compared with 
GRFT, the KT-MFP method has lower computational cost without 
the BSSL effect.

4.5. Coherent integration for multiple targets 

In this section, we evaluate the coherent integration ability of 
KT-MFP for multiple targets and the motion parameters of tar- 
get A and B are listed in Table 4 . The radar parameters are given 
in Table 2 and the SNRs (after PC) of the two targets are both 
6 dB. The simulation results of KT-MFP for multiple targets are

given in Fig. 9 . Particularly, Fig. 9 (a) shows the result after the 
PC while Fig. 9 (b) gives the jointly searching result of fold fac- 
tors and accelerations. Specically, the estimated fold factors are 
1 for the two targets, separately. Besides, according to the 
1 and 
15 m 
peak values, the estimated accelerations are 20 m/s 
2 and 
Fig. 9 (c) gives the estimation result of unambiguous velocities. As 
13 
for target A, the estimated unambiguous velocity is 
 82 m 
and then we can work out that the estimation of target A＊s ve- 
locity is 79.93 m/s. In terms of target B, the estimated unambigu- 
6 
ous velocity is 
 31 m 
 s and the estimated velocity is equal to 
100 
 06 m 
 s . Furthermore, Fig. 9 (d) gives the coherent integration 
result via the proposed method and we can see that the energy 
of the two targets is well focused. It should be noted that if the 
scattering intensities of different targets differ signicantly, we can 
use the CLEAN technique to realize the coherent integration (as an- 
alyzed in Section 3.3 ). Finally, we can conclude that KT-MFP is also 
effective for the coherent integration of multiple targets. 
Overall, for the low-speed target, the proposed method could 
eliminate the RM and DFM effectively to integrate the energy well.

Moreover, it has a better detection performance than RFT, IAR- 
FRFT and KT-FRFT. Although there is a slight loss for the detec- 
tion performance compared with GRFT, the proposed method has 
lower computational cost. While in terms of the coherent integra- 
tion for a high-speed target, the proposed algorithm can still per- 
form well to accumulate the energy when RFT, IAR-FRFT and KT- 
FRFT all become invalid and there appears the BSSL effect for the 
GRFT method. Additionally, the last simulation has validated the 
coherent integration ability of KT-MFP for multiple targets. 

energy is achieved via the slow time FT. The simulations about the 
coherent integration ability and detection performance have been 
carried out in detail. In general, the results show that the KT-MFP 
method is able to perform well whether for the low-speed tar- 
get or the high-speed target and could avoid the BSSL effect but 
requires lower computational complexity compared with GRFT. In 
addition, the detection performance of KT-MFP outperforms that of 
RFT, IAR-FRFT and KT-FRFT. 

5. Conclusion 

Acknowledgments 

In this paper, we have presented a new method named KT-MFP 
for the weak maneuvering target detection. The KT-MFP method 
can both eliminate the RM and DFM effects within the coherent 
pulse interval. In particular, this method rstly corrects the linear 
RM resulted from the unambiguous velocity via KT and then per- 
forms the MFP in the range frequency-slow time domain to elim- 
inate the residual RM (including the residual linear RM caused by 
the blind velocity and the quadratic RM resulted from the accel- 
eration) and the DFM. Finally, coherent integration of the target＊s
