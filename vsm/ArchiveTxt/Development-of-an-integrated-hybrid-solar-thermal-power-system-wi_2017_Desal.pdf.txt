abstract

In this study, an integrated system for desalinated water and electricity production is developed and thermody-
namically analyzed. The proposed system consists of a solar-natural gas hybrid power plant, thermoelectric gen-
erator (TEG), Rankine cycle to produce electricity and ash distillation unit to produce fresh water. The proposed
electricity-fresh water co-generation plant uses solar driven volumetric pressurized air receivers as main power
supply and uses natural gas to compensate power when the direct normal irradiance is below 900 W/m2. Ther-
moelectric materials are used to generate electricity from waste heat of gas turbine. Flash distillation unit is used
to produce fresh water from seawater by the waste heat of Rankine cycle. All thermodynamic quantities, such as
energy and exergy efciencies, exergy destructions are calculated for all system components. The combustion re-
action is modelled on ASPEN Plus software package. TEG unit is modelled on COMSOL Multiphysics software
package, and the rest of the elements of the system are analyzed in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The
overall exergy and energy efciencies of the system are determined to be 54.9% and 44.5% respectively where
the total energy input comes 50% from solar system and 50% from natural gas. The results show that TEG unit
can generate power more than 32 kW by using the waste heat. The present results indicate that it is possible
to produce 3.36 kg/s of fresh water from proposed system. Furthermore, the effects of direct normal irradiance
level, ambient wind speed, seawater temperature, various cool side cooling options for the thermoelectric gener-
ator on the system performance are investigated.

1. Introduction

The purpose of using renewable energies is mainly reducing carbon
emissions in the world. CO2 emissions are expected to cause a very vital
problem in the world as the growth rate of the population and quality of
life continue rising [1]. The most signicant benet of solar energy,
when it is compared with other energy sources, is that it is clean and
can be provided without any ecological pollution. Fossil fuels have sup-
plied most of the world's energy demand over the past century. As they

are less inexpensive and more useful than energy from alternative ener-
gy sources, they are more preferable. By the development of solar power
systems, it is possible to operate a gas turbine with direct normal
heating of pressurized air.
In 2005, the European Commission [1] published their nal report
on SOLGATE project. In their project, a volumetric solar receiver is de-
veloped to heat up the pressurized air to 1000 ∼C. Hot pressurized air
provides energy to gas turbine. Peng et al. [2] proposed a solar tower
thermal power system integrating the intercooled gas turbine top
cycle and the Kalina bottoming cycle. Solar part of the proposed system
is using pressurized air receivers as in SOLGATE project. Consequently,
the highest solar-to-electric efciency of the suggested system is obtain-
ed 27.5% at a gas turbine inlet temperature of 1000 ∼C.

Meriche et al. [3] proposed a hybrid solar tower power plant using
pressurized air receiver and investigate it with and without the pres-
ence of regenerator. The suggested power plant has 27% and 33% overall
thermal efciency with and without the presence of regenerator,
respectively.
Thermoelectric materials are semiconductor materials, which can
convert heat to electricity by Seebeck effect and vice versa. As thermo-
electric generators do not have any moving parts, they are easy to oper-
ate and have low maintenance cost. Hence utilization of these systems is
a reasonable method to generate clean energy. However, thermoelectric
generators have low thermal efciencies [4]. As a result of this situation,
they are mostly used for waste heat management applications. Orr et al.
[5] made an experimental work for waste heat recovery from exhaust
gases of a car by using thermoelectric cells. The temperature difference
between hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric cells was maintained
by heat pipes in the proposed system. As a result of their study, the max-
imum power which the cells can produce was 6.03 W with 1.43% ef-
ciency. Omer and Ineld [6] proposed a two-stage parabolic
concentrator and thermoelectric materials be attached on absorber
plates to use waste heat. Sahin et al. [7] also made a similar study by in-
vestigating the performance of a conventional solar concentration
power plant with and without the presence of thermoelectric devices.
In the suggested system, thermoelectric devices are installed on heat
collector element. As a result, the thermal efciency of the system
with thermoelectric devices is calculated slightly higher than the same
system without the thermoelectric generators. Thermoelectric genera-
tors are also used to recover the waste heat of gas turbines. Francis
et al. [8] proposed a gas turbine system in which the efciency was in-
creased by 10% with the presence of thermoelectric generator.
Desalination is a technology to get rid of dissolved solids and ions
from briny water, seawater, or industrial wastewater. The purpose is
to produce clean water from seawater or brackish water or recover pol-
luted water in an engineering process [9]. Desalination technologies can
be categorized as the membrane-based and thermal-based separation
processes. Reverse osmosis (RO), multi-stage ash (MSF), and multi-
effect distillation (MED) are the core technologies for commercial-
scale [9]. Khalid et al. [10] made a comparative assessment of two sys-
tems for nuclear desalination. The systems use Reverse Osmosis (RO)
for desalination and are coupled with either a CANDU 6 nuclear reactor
or a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR). As a result of the study, the co-
generation exergy efciency and RO process exergy efciency of the
CANDU 6-based system are obtained higher than the SFR-based system.
Cardona et al. [11] proposed an integrated system for the desalination of
the seawater. In the proposed system, reverse osmosis and multistage
ash distillation units connected in series. As a result of the study, the
proposed plant provides cost reduction for the fresh water, when it is
compared to the equivalent systems in parallel. Hawlader et al. [12] pro-
posed and built a system with a single effect desalination unit. The desa-
lination unit is connected to a solar assisted heat pump. They
investigated the effects of feed seawater temperature and ashing. As
a result, the maximum performance ratio of the desalination unit is ob-
tained 1.15.
Seawater desalination plants with solar thermal power are consid-
ered a clean way to produce fresh water from seawater. There are vari-
ous applications in this area such as solar energy multi-stage ash
systems (MSF), solar energy MED systems, solar energy compressing
distillation systems, etc. For example, a solar energy driven multi-
stage ash desalination system was constructed in Kuwait with a
7000-liter reservoir and a 220 m groove-shaped parabolic heat collector
and a capacity of 10 t of fresh water per day [13]. Ortega-Delgado [14]
made a thermo-economic analysis of electricity and water cogenerative
Solar Thermal Power Plant (STPP) of 5 MW. Their system is equipped
with parabolic trough mirrors and Direct Steam Generation (DSG).
They compared two distillation technologies which were Multi-Effect
Distillation (MED) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) to nd the best arrange-
ment of integration with the STPP. An average daily operation of the

system (with fresh water production, plant capacity, net electric and
thermal power consumption, specic consumption of auxiliaries and
specic consumption of the process) is taken into account to choose
the best option. Their results show that the best integrated system
choice is with the reverse osmosis unit which is connected to the local
electric grid [14]. Palenzuela et al. [15] proposed four different com-
bined concentrating solar power plants with a large-scale desalination
plant. In their system, it is possible to produce fresh water from reverse
osmosis and thermal desalination systems. As they coupled reverse os-
mosis and thermal desalination plants with CSP plant, they reduced the
cooling load on CSP and recovered the waste heat of it while producing
fresh water. It is possible to produce 47,723 m3/kg fresh water per day
and 62.42 MWe energy. Palenzuela et al. [16] made another study of
performance assessment of different potential desalination units inte-
grated with concentrating solar power plant. They investigated low-
temperature multi-effect distillation and thermal vapor compression
multi-effect distillation combined with a concentrating solar power
plant. They also connected a reverse osmosis unit to the plant as an al-
ternative conguration. Palenzuela et al. [17] investigated four different
congurations of the CSP based desalination system in arid regions.
Their system was capable of generating 50 MWe power and producing
48,498 m3/day fresh water. In regards to the plants with smaller capac-
ities, there are various studies focused on relatively small-scale concen-
trated solar based desalination systems [18每20]. Iaquniello et al. [18]
proposed a system which consists of a CSP plant integrated with MED-
RO distillation unit to be able to produce around 20,000 m3 fresh
water per day.
Garcia-Rodriguez et al. [21] investigated solar assisted multi-stage
ash distillation systems. They made a comprehensive comparison be-
tween a traditional MSF system with a solar assisted one. For the solar
assisted MSF system solar collectors heat the brine when the sunlight
is available, and during night, a traditional energy supply runs the MSF
system. The climatic conditions, desalination plant capacity and perfor-
mance ratio of the system, and costs are taken into account in the study.
As a result, the study indicates that solar-assisted systems can be prot-
able compared to conventional MSF systems. Furthermore, potential
price reduction on parabolic through collectors and cost rising in the
fossil fuels will affect the competitiveness of solar energy in MSF plants
notably.

In this study, a water-electric cogeneration system is developed. The
proposed system consists of the solar-natural gas hybrid power plant,
thermoelectric generator (TEG), Rankine cycle and Flash distillation
unit for producing fresh water. The combined co-generation power-
desalination plant uses volumetric pressurized solar receivers as main
power supply and uses natural gas to compensate the decient power
when the direct normal irradiance is below 900 W/m2.
Thermoelectric materials are used to generate electricity from waste
heat of gas turbine and ash distillation unit is used to produce fresh
water from seawater from waste heat of Rankine cycle. Both compo-
nents utilize the waste heat and increase the overall efciency of the
system. Both TEG and FDU are also selected as environmentally friendly
components. Neither of them causes any greenhouse gas emissions
while producing their products which affects the environmental impact
of the system positively. They both are simple designs. TEG has no mov-
ing part, what makes its maintenance cost cheap. FDU has only pumps
as moving parts. By using solar power, thermoelectric effect and ash
distillation it is aimed to produce clean energy and water.
All thermodynamic parameters, such as energy and exergy efcien-
cies, exergy destructions, temperature, pressure, specic enthalpy and
entropy are calculated for all system components. The combustion reac-
tion is modelled on ASPEN Plus software package. TEG unit is modelled
on COMSOL Multiphysics software package and rest of the components
of the system is constructed in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES).
Furthermore, the effects of solar radiation level, ambient wind speed,
seawater temperature, thermoelectric generator cool side cooling
method are investigated.

Rankine cycle, integrated with ash distillation unit (FDU) and Thermo-
electric generator unit (TEG) to generate electricity from waste heat.
In the proposed system, the compressor compresses air from
100 kPa to 1410 kPa. The compressed air ows to pressurized air receiv-
er and heats up to 1207 K. When the solar radiation is not sufcient; nat-
ural gas compensates the decient heat by burning in the combustion
chamber. When solar radiation reaches its peak level, air stream by-
passes the combustion chamber, and Brayton cycle runs with only
solar power. On the other hand, after sunset, air stream by-passes
solar receiver and directly ows to the combustion chamber. In Fig. 2,
hourly variation of direct normal irradiance (DNI) and solar energy con-
tribution to the Brayton Cycle can be seen. In this study, it is assumed
that solar energy can be useful for 12 h per day, and maximum DNI is
900 W/m2. The pressurized high-temperature air ows to the gas tur-
bine to produce electricity. The exhaust gas of the Brayton cycle ows
to heat exchanger (HEX 1) to generate steam for Rankine cycle. After
the ue gas passes through the HEX 1, it enters the thermoelectric gen-
erator to produce electricity from waste heat.
Tin sulde (SnS) and Bismuth Telluride (Be2Te3) are selected as
thermoe lec tric mater ials for TEG . TEGs are insta lled on tubes and
cover them a l l . Wh i le seawater is pumped by c ircu lat ing pump
ow ing ins ide the tube , the hot ue gas ows around the tubes .
Since a temperature d ifference occurs between both sides of TEG ,
electricity is generated. Geometry for TEG unit is modied version
of parameter ized she ll-and-tube heat exchanger geometry in

In parallel, the Rankine cycle also generates electricity. After the
steam exits from steam turbine as wet steam , it enters a heat
exchanger (HEX 2) to heat seawater up to 55 ∼C. Medium tempera-
ture seawater enters F lash Dist i l lat ion Un it to produce d ist i l led
water at low pressure . At the beg inning of the system, a vacuum
pump runs for the set d ist i l lat ion tank pressure to reduce the
pressure to 4.5 kPa .

3. Thermodynamic analyses

The energy and exergy efciencies, exergy destructions, temper-
ature, pressure, specic enthalpy and entropy are calculated for all
system components . The combustion reaction is model led on
ASPEN Plus software package . TEG unit is mode lled on COMSOL
Mu lt iphys ics software package and rest of the components of the
system is constructed in the Eng ineering Equat ion Solver (EES) .
The genera l des ign parameters and assumpt ions made for the
analysis are listed in Table 1.
Beside parameters in Table 1, the following assumptions are made
for the study:

 The changes in potential and kinetic energies are negligible.
 The only chemical reaction occurs in the combustion chamber.
 The heat losses to the environment occur only at heliostat surface.
 Ideal gas principles apply for the gases.

The energy balance, according to the rst law of thermodynamics, is
applied to each component of the system. Energy balance equation for

3.2. Thermoelectric generator

The thermoelectric effect is considered a phenomenon that provides
direct and reversible conversion between thermal and electrical energy.
This phenomenon is also known as ※Seebeck Effect§ where a thermo-
electric generator is utilized to produce electricity from temperature dif-
ference and ※Thompson Effect§ where a thermoelectric generator is
utilized to produce cooling effect through a voltage difference.
A dimensionless gure of merit is dened to demonstrate the ther-
moelectric performance. Thermal efciency of a TEG is related to ZT.
As the value of ZTincreases, thermodynamic performance of the TEG

where T is the average temperature between the hot (TH) and cold sides
(TC) of thermoelectric material.
Here,
_WTEG is generated power by TEG and _Q TEG is the heat transfer
rate between cold and hot side of TEG. Tin sulde (SnS) and Bismuth
Telluride (Be2Te3) are selected as thermoelectric materials for TEG
where the properties of selected thermoelectric materials are presented
in Table 2.
In order to determine _Q TEG,TH and Tc, a numerical analysis is done by
COMSOL Multiphysics Software Package. k-汍 turbulence model is used
in the numerical analysis to model turbulent ow in TEG. The numerical
study is conducted under steady state conditions. Mesh elements used
in the numerical study can be seen in Fig. 3 whereas the mesh statistics
are presented in Table 4. (See Fig. 4.)
Seven different mesh elements are used in the current numerical
study. They are distributed in the model according to physic of the prob-
lem. Mesh frequency is increased closer to the wall. When the DNI is 450
W/m2, hot side of TEG is fed by 500 ∼C ue gas temperature with
42.26 kg/s mass ow rate and cold side of TEG is fed by seawater
pumped by circulating pump with temperature 20 ∼C and speed
_Q TEG is determined as 1627.5 kW and
5 m/s. Under these conditions,

thermal efciency of TEG 灰TEG is determined as 2.02%. It means
32.94 kW electricity can be produced by TEG. It is important for a ther-
moelectric generator to keep temperature difference between cold and
hot sides as much as possible, because efciency is highly dependent on
the temperature difference. The temperature distribution on TEG unit
can be seen in Fig. 5. As it is presented in Fig. 5, the temperature of
water inlet and exit of TEG unit slightly changes. It can be attributed
to two main reasons: Firstly, thermal conductivity of TEG has small
value (1.5 W/m K), secondly water passes through the TEG unit in 1.2 s.

3.3. Flash distillation unit

A single-stage ash distillation unit (FDU) used in the system is
shown in Fig. 6. The seawater comes to the system with 20 ∼C and heat-
ed up by the wet steam, which leaves the steam turbine. The tempera-
ture of the seawater reaches 55 ∼C when it leaves the heat exchanger.
After seawater heats up, it enters the FDU and condensates at low-
pressure media and distillate product is collected for domestic purposes.
The system designed as an open system. Heat rejection of the system is
provided by seawater pumped by a circulation pump. Brine water is
rejected to sea at about 32 ∼C.
Multiple effect distillation plants and multiple stage ash distillation
plants are considered thermodynamically more efcient than single
stage distillation units. The number of their stages can reach more
than 20 stages which increase the required space for these units.

Moreover, most of MSF plants operate at top brine temperatures of
90每120 ∼C [29]. The brine temperature decreases gradually in every
stage. In this study, top brine temperature is only 55 ∼C, which is rela-
tively low for multiple stage distillation processes. [29]. On the other
hand, the single stage distillation units are considered to be an excellent
option for seawater distillation when the compact size of the design is
important. Furthermore, such systems are treated as a feasible option
where there is surplus and inexpensive heat.
In this study, the heat extracted from the condenser of the Rankine
cycle is aimed to be used for distillation purposes. A single ash distilla-
tion system is selected based on the following criteria: low steam tem-
perature, low cost, smaller and more compact design, smaller capacities,
etc. In Table 5 [30], some of small scaled desalination plants are listed.
The desalination capacity of listed plants varies from 125 m3/day to
586 m3/day. In this study, the desired capacity of desalination plant is
targeted to be at least 250 m3/day. The desalination model is built on
the following assumptions [31]:

 The distillate product is salt-free.
 The specic heat of seawater is taken as 4.18 kJ/kg K.
 The subcooling of condensate and superheating of heating steam have
a negligible effect on the system energy balance.
 The power requirements for vacuum pump are not included in the
system analysis.
 The heat losses from the system are negligible.

The total mass balance of the system can be written as [31]:

The desalination model is built with the help of a reference book

The experimental and theoretical studies of Nafey et al. [20] are used
for validation of the model. They built a small ash desalination unit
for water by so lar energy and made a both theoretical and
experimental study. Their experimental setup is quite similar to the
FDU used in this study. Their system consists of a brine heater and
a vertical ash unit. The ash unit is connected to a condenser/pre-
heater . Measured resu lts and theoretica l nd ings ca lcu lated by

4. Results and discussion

Thermodynamic calculations of each system components are per-
formed by using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software. The values
of temperature (K), pressure (kPa), mass ow rate (kg/s), specic en-
thalpy (kJ/kg), specic entropy (kJ/kg K), and specic exergy (kJ/kg)
are determined for the each state point of the system as listed in Table 7.
The values of exergy destruction rate (kW), exergy efciency (%),
work rate or heat transfer rate (kW) of each system component are pre-
sented in Table 8. Tables 7 and 8 present the values when the solar con-
tribution to the system is 50% (DNI = 450 W/m2).
As seen in Table 8 and Fig. 8, the maximum exergy destruction rates
are determined in combustion chamber and gas turbine. It is because of
high irreversibility of the components. The exergy efciency of the gas
turbine is observed as almost 80%. As presented in Table 8 and Fig. 8,
the exergy destruction rates of valves and pump have the lowest share
in the overall system. The heat losses at solar receiver are taken into ac-
count in this study. Hence, it causes large exergy destruction rate on this
component. Another reason of this situation can also be explained as
the heat transfer through solar receiver occurs at high-temperature differ-
ences. To decrease the exergy destruction rate on this component, the
heat losses need to be decreased. Fig. 9 presents exergy efciencies of

each component of the system when DNI is 450 W/m2. The compressor
has the highest exergy efciency with 91% and thermoelectric generator
has smallest exergy efciency with 5.32%. The main reason of low exergy
efciency of thermoelectric generator is thermoelectric generators`
power generation capacity. Since the energy efciency of TEG is 2%, it
causes low energy production relatively to heat transfer rate between
the hot and cold side of TEG.
The generated power by system components are comparatively
presented in Fig. 10. As it is expected, the lowest power is produced
by TEG and h ighest power is generated by the gas turb ine .
19,150 kW, 2632 kW and 32.94 kW electricity produced by the gas
turbine , steam turbine and TEG respectively . The ash dist i llat ion
un it produces 290 m3 fresh water per day . The FDU capac ity is in
the same range as the desalination plants in Table 5.

4.1. Parametric studies

4.1.1. Effects of direct normal irradiance
Fig . 11 represents the change of the overall energy and exergy
efciencies throughout a day. As it can be seen in Fig. 11, the exergy
efciency is more depended on solar contribution. The reason of that,
as it shown in Fig . 8 , the exergy destruction rate of combust ion
chamber has larger values relatively. As the mass ow rate of natural
gas decreases , the exergy destruction rate of combustion chamber
decreases, too resulting in higher exergy efciencies.

In Fig. 12, the mass ow rate of CO2 emission and mass ow rate
of natural gas are presented at each hour in a day. As the mass ow
rate of fuel increases, the CO2 emission level also increases. It reaches
maximum level (1.5 kg/s) when the solar contribution is 0%. When
the direct normal irradiance reaches 900 W/m2, the carbon emission
level lowers down to 0 kg/s.

4.1.2. Effects of temperature of seawater
Fig . 13 presents the change of performance ratio and seawater
intake o f the ash d ist illat ion unit with seawater temperature .
According to Fig. 13, as the sea temperature increases, there is less
intake seawater requirement to produce the same amount of fresh
water . As the seawater temperature increases , the required heat
transfer rate will be less to reach the same top brine temperature .
There fore , the ow rate of water intake water w i l l be sma l ler .
However, the performance ratio of FDU also decreases with seawater
temperature.

4.1.3. Effects of TEG cooling side heat rejection type
In this sec tion , heat reject ion from the cool junct ion o f the
thermoelectric generator is investigated. In order to produce elec-
tricity from the thermoelectric material, the temperature difference
between hot and cold sides should be maintained. In the proposed
design , hot and cold s ides of the thermoelectr ic material are
provided by ue gas and seawater pumped by circulating pump
respectively. To see the effect of heat rejection type from TEG, two

more alternative cool side cooling are proposed. First one is cooling
with the ambient wind without any component and the second one
is cooling with the help of a blower which blows the air instead of
pumping the seawater. Air velocity after blower is 15 m/s.

In Fig. 14, Power generation by TEG with three cool side options is
presented. It can be seen in the gure that the highest power can be
generated from circulating pump option and the least power is gen-
erated by natural cooling option. The main reason for this situation
