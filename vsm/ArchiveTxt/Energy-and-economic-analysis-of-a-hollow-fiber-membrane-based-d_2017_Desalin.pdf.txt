abstract

A novel solar energy driven and membrane-based air humidication-dehumidication desalination (MHDD)
system is designed and constructed. To realize a water-salt separation, a hollow ber membrane module is
employed as the humidier to humidify air with solar energy heated saline water. The humidied air is then
cooled and condensed to obtain distilled water. A detailed theoretical model is developed and validated to eval-
uate the performance of the proposed MHDD system. The whole model includes submodels for the solar collec-
tor, the water tank, the membrane humidier, and the vapor condenser. At a specied membrane area, the effects
of the water tank volume and solar collector area on the system performance such as the electric energy con-
sumption for water production (SEC), the coefcient of performance (COP), etc., are analyzed. The optimal
water tank volume and the optimal solar collector area for the desalination system are evaluated. In addition,
an economic analysis on the whole system reveals that the system needs a low maintenance cost to make the
water production competitive. Generally it provides an attractive alternative to small-scale, stand-alone desalina-
tion systems that could provide high purity drinkable water.

1. Introduction
Global population growth and economic development have resulted
in a sharp increase in the demand for fresh water [1]. Water shortage is
becoming a worldwide challenge. Although over 71% of the earth's sur-
face is covered with water, about 97.5% of water on the earth is sea or
brackish water which contains large amounts of salt. As a result, desali-
nation of sea or brackish water becomes the most feasible solution to
overcome fresh water shortage. Desalination can be accomplished by
a number of techniques [2每10]. Generally, these techniques can be di-
vided into following categories: (1) Thermal processes that involve
phase change like Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) [2] and Multi Stage
Flash (MSF) [3]. (2) Membrane processes without phase change like Re-
verse Osmosis (RO) [4,5], Nano Filtration (NF) [6] and Electro Dialysis
(ED) [7]. (3) Hybrid processes that involve both phase change and
membranes like membrane distillation (MD) [8每10].
Above thermal processes are energy intensive [11,12]. Application of
MSF helps the Middle East to hold nearly about 50% of the world's desali-
nation capacity. However, recently with the development of membrane
technology, RO desalination method has rapidly been adopted since the
1960s. It now surpasses the thermal processes in new plant installations.
At the end of 2009, over 15,000 desalination plants were in operation
world-wide, and approximately 50% of those were RO plants [12]. How-
ever, reverse osmosis based membrane technology is relied heavily on
precious high-pressure mechanical energy. Besides energy intensive, it
has maintenance problems [13].
The use of solar energy in desalination represents a promising trend.
Because solar thermal energy is a low-grade heat, desalination systems
that can be driven by low-grade heat should be searched. In this respect,
the solar powered air humidication-dehumidication desalination
process is regarded as a favorable technique [14,15]. According to this
concept, solar heated sea water is used to humidify the air. The humid-
ied air is then cooled and condensed to produce distilled water. Air hu-
midication can be effectively realized even if the sea water is heated to
60 to 80 ∼C, so it's a good candidate for solar energy use. There have been
many studies of solar energy driven desalination with humidication-
dehumidication cycles. Usually packed columns, where the hot sea
water and air stream are in a direct contact, are used for air humidica-
tion. Farsad et al. [16] studied a solar desalination unit with humidica-
tion每dehumidication cycle. A packed tower as a humidier was used
in the system. The heated solution from solar collector is immediately
transported to the humidier and it is in a direct contact with air on
the surface of packing. Al-Sulaiman [17] also set up a solar desalination
system using humidication-dehumidication processes. The air is hu-
midied through the direct contact with the water in the humidier.
Zhani [18] constructed a plant consisting of a at plate solar air collector,
a at plate solar water collector, a pad humidier, an evaporation tower
and a condensation tower. For solar powered systems, heat storage is
necessary due to the intermittent nature of solar energy heating [19,
20]. However the above mentioned studies did not have thermal energy
storage devices. Most importantly, all these plants used packed columns
to humidify. The coherent problem with direct contact packed columns
is that sea water droplets may be carried over to air streams, which
would subsequently condensed into the production water. As a result,
the purity of the production water would be sacriced. Another setback
of packed columns is that the humidication efciency is low due to
ow maldistribution.
To overcome these problems, this research set up a solar energy
driven membrane-based humidication dehumidication desalination
system (MHDD). Instead of a packed column a hollow ber membrane
module, in which air is humidied by water through membranes, is
used to substitute the packed column. Since water and air stream are
separated by membranes, the problem of water droplets crossover is
thus solved. Besides, a water tank is used to storage solar energy, thus
the problem from the intermittent nature of solar energy use is over-
come. To theoretically investigate the system, a mathematical model
of the system is developed. The humidier, the dehumidier, the solar
collector and the thermal energy storage unit are modeled in detail to
analyze the system performance. The optimum sizes of the solar collec-
tor and the storage tank for the given membrane module are investigat-
ed. An economic analysis on the whole system is also performed to
investigate the feasibility.

2. System description and experimental setup

2.1. System description

Based on the membrane type humidication每dehumidication pro-
cesses, a solar energy powered MHDD system is designed and set up in
SCUT. The real photos and the schematic sketch of the system are pre-
sented in Figs. 1 and 2 respectively. The system mainly consists of a
solar collector (contains 36 U-tube glass evacuated tube solar collec-
tors), a heat storage water tank with a coil heat exchanger inside, a
membrane-based humidier (a hollow ber membrane module) and
a dehumidier (a n-and-tube heat exchanger). The solar collector
combined with a heat storage tank is employed to capture and store
the uctuant solar energy. In this experiment, NaCl solution with a
mass fraction of 3.5% is used to substitute sea water. The collected ener-
gy is transferred to the NaCl solution in the tank by the heat transfer
media (distilled water) through the coil heat exchanger. The novel
cross-ow hollow ber membrane module developed in our laboratory
is used as the humidier. The bers are made with modied porous
membranes. Composite membranes in the module are composed of
two layers: a porous polymer PVDF (polyvinylidene uoride) layer
and a dense PVAL (polyvinyl alcohol) skin layer. The hydrophobic
PVDF layer mainly provides the mechanical strength. It also prevents
liquid molecules from entering the pores of membranes which has
been veried by a long time experiment. Meanwhile the hydrophilic
PVAL skin layer provides the permselectivity and improves the perme-
ate ux due to low resistance for moisture transfer. The physical struc-
ture, composition and heat and mass transport data of the membrane
bers including membrane thickness (汛m), ber outer diameter (do),
thermal conductivity of membrane (竹m) and moisture diffusivity in
membrane (Dvm) are described elsewhere [21] and also listed in Table
2. The heated saline water then ows through the bers, while the
fresh air from a fan ows outside the bers in the shell side of the mod-
ule. The surface tension forces between the water and the hydrophobic
membrane prevent liquid molecules from entering the pores of mem-
branes. Under trans-membrane vapor partial pressure differences,
water vapor from saline water inside the bers can pass through the
pores. It is then absorbed by the air stream outside the bers. Thus,
heat and mass transfer are achieved between the hot saline water and
the air streams. Then the saline water ows back to the water tank to
be heated again. The heated and humidied air at the exit of the humid-
ier then passes through the dehumidier, where it is cooled and the
vapor contained is condensed into distilled water. The produced fresh
water is collected at the bottom of the dehumidier and it is stored in
the fresh water storage tank.

2.2. Experimental setup

An experimental study is conducted to investigate the feasibility of
using solar energy for the MHDD system. The whole system is divided
into the outdoor part (a solar collector) and the indoor part (a heat stor-
age water tank and a humidication-dehumidication desalination
unit) as shown in Fig. 1.
The solar collector of glass evacuated tube type has high efciencies
compared to at plate type collectors because it has a highly selective
surface coating and a vacuum insulation for the absorber element [22].
U-tube evacuated solar collector as one of the glass evacuated tube
solar collectors has the advantages of high-pressure-bearing ability. It
can also eliminate the impact of glass evacuated tube cracking caused
by frequent cold and hot water alternate shocking, because the water
is in U copper tubes instead of in the glass tubes. In view of the above
characteristics, a 36 U-tube evacuated solar collector is used in this sys-
tem, and each collector tube is double-glazed. Between the outer and
inner glass, a vacuum jacket is made to eliminate the convective heat
losses from the collector to the outside environment. A U copper tube
is wedged inside an aluminum n that is in a close contact with the

inner glass tube, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In order to transfer the heat en-
ergy between the collector and the saline water inside the tank, a
50 m long coiled tube made of 316L stainless steel is used and placed in-
side the tank. The outside of the heat storage tank is covered by a 5 cm
thick polyurethane foam to insulate heat transfer from the inside to the
environment. The inner shell of the tank is made of 304 stainless steel.
304 and 316L stainless steels are used to ensure the equipment are cor-
rosion resistant to saline water. The U-tubes in the evacuated solar col-
lector and the coiled tube in the heat storage tank are lled with
distilled water in advance as the heat transport media. Parameters of
the solar collector, the heat storage tank and the coil heat exchanger
are listed in Table 1. In this system, a hollow ber membrane module
made in our laboratory is used as the humidier. The detailed illustra-
tion of the structure is shown in Fig. 3(a). The production process and
the real photo of the module can be found in [23]. The silicone tube is
used as distilled water and saline water lines. The membrane module
and the saline water lines are covered by PVC (polyvinyl chloride)
heat insulation cotton to reduce the heat losses. The dehumidier is a
n-and-tube heat exchanger. 42 tubes made with 316L stainless steel
are mounted by aluminum ns. At the bottom of the dehumidier, a
collecting trough is designed to collect the produced fresh water into

the fresh water storage tank as depicted in Fig. 4. The structure and
the physical parameters of the humidier and the dehumidier are
listed in Table 2. The n-and-tube heat exchanger is used as the dehu-
midier because heat transfer coefcient at the air side is signicantly
lower than that of solution side. Those aluminum ns provide greater
heat transfer areas, improving heat transfer efciency at the air side.
In addition, one 6 W corrosion resistant magnetic circulating pump is
used to transport the hot solution to the humidier. Another one is
used to transport the cold water (substitute sea water) to the dehumid-
ier. A centrifugal fan with frequency conversion governor is used to
supply various air volumes for the system. A control display panel is
used to display the water temperature at inlet and outlet of the collec-
tor. A Data Transmission System (DTS) is used to collect temperature
and humidity data of the uids. They are then transferred to a computer.
Several screens are placed inside and along the air duct to uniformly dis-
tribute the air stream. In order to maintain constant inlet air states, the
indoor part of the system is installed in an air-conditioned room whose
temperature and humidity conditions are set to the typical local weath-
er conditions.

2.3. Measurement devices

In order to evaluate the system performance, several key parameters
are to be measured such as, ow rates of air and solution streams,

electrode with an accuracy of ㊣ 0.5% is used to measure the electrical
conductivity of the produced water.

3. Mathematical modeling

3.1. Evacuated solar collector

The solar collector used in this system consists of 36 U-tube evac-
uated so lar co l lectors , wh ich are connected in ser ies by the p ipe
header . A solar radiation sensor placed at the same slope with the
collector is used to measure the outdoor solar radiation as shown
in Fig. 1(a). To obtain the useful energy collected by the solar collec-
tor, the mathematical model is established taking into account the
following assumptions:

(1) The energy stored in the collector is negligible.
(2) The ow rate of water inside the collector tube is constant.
(3) In the vacuum jacket, air convective heat loss and heat conduc-
tion loss are negligible.
(4) The uid temperature remains under 100 ∼C. During the opera-
tion time, the uid has no phase change.
(5) Solar energy absorption by the outer glass is negligible. Only the
energy absorbed by the inner absorber glass is considered.

The collector heat removal factor (FR) is the ratio of useful heat ob-
tained in collector to the heat collected by collector, and it can be
expressed as:

Based on the above assumption, the useful solar energy (qsolar) is

A coil heat exchanger placed in the heat storage tank is used to trans-
fer the energy collected by the solar collector to the water in the tank, as

shown in Fig. 2. The following equations present the corresponding

where, Ucoil is the overall heat transfer coefcient of the coil in the stor-
age tank, Acoil is the heat transfer area of the coil, those structure param-
eters of the coil heat exchanger can be found in Table 1.
Assuming that the inlet and outlet water temperatures of the coil
heat exchanger are equal to the outlet and inlet water temperatures of
the solar collector respectively, and then 忖T2 and 忖T1 can be written as:
忖T 2  T f ;oT s and 忖T 1  T f ;iT s

7

where Ts is the temperature of water in the heat storage tank.

3.3. Heat storage tank

Due to the intermittent nature of solar energy, a thermal energy
storage unit (TES) is used in this system. For the energy balance and
governing equations of the heat storage tank the following assumptions
are considered:

(1) Water tank is a completely mixed storage tank, and the temper-
ature distribution inside the saline water storage tank is homoge-
neous.
(2) For this well mixed model, solution temperature (Ts) and con-
centration (Xs) in the tank is equal to the inlet solution tempera-
ture (Ts,i) and concentration (Xs,i) of the humidier.
(3) The heat loss coefcient from the tank to the environment is con-
stant.
(4) Since water tank is located indoors, the temperature of the in-
door environment is equal to the inlet air temperature to the hu-
midier (Ta,i).

In the process of dynamic operation, the water in the tank has a var-
iable level and a variable temperature. The energy balance equation of
the storage tank without makeup water is represented as follows:

where Ts,i is the temperature to the humidier (leaving the tank), and
Ts,o is the temperature outlet the humidier (reaching the tank). ms,i
and ms,o are the inlet and outlet mass ow rates of the saline water of
the humidier respectively as shown in Fig. 3. Based on mass conserva-
tion, ms,o can be written as:

where 肋a,i and 肋a,o are the inlet air humidity and the outlet air humidity
of the humidier respectively. In Eq. (8), qloss,t is the heat loss from the
tank to the indoor environment:

3.4. Hollow ber membrane humidier

As a separation equipment, the hollow ber membrane module is a
key unit in the system. It is like a cross-ow shell-and-tube heat mass

exchanger. Air stream ows in a cross ow manner across the hollow
ber tube bank. The ber-to-ber modeling is not likely considering
that there are numerous bers. Therefore a parallel-plates heat mass ex-
changer modeling as an alternative approach is used in this section. The
detail is described in Ref [23]. The convective heat transfer coefcients h
(kW m 2 K 1) and the convective mass transfer coefcient k (m/s) of
solution and air can be represented by Nusselt numbers and Sherwood
number respectively as:

Nu  hd

13

where 竹 is heat conductivity, Le is the Lewis Number. D is diffusivity,
which represents Dws, water diffusivity in solution for the tube side,
and Dva, moisture diffusivity in air for the shell side, respectively.
Since the Re for the air stream and the solution stream (in the ne -
bers) are all much less than 2300, both air and solution can be considered
to be laminar. For fully developed laminar heat transfer in round tubes:

tion temperature of the tank is set to 50 ∼C after an overnight insulating,
with a concentration 3.5%, and a volume 80 L. The inlet temperature of
the cold water is 28 ∼C (under the condition of room temperature)
and cold water ow rate is chose at 160 L/h. The experiments were car-
ried out on 28 Aug., 2015 and the measured operating values of solar ra-
diation and ambient temperature during a day in Guangzhou, China, are
shown in Fig. 6. Considering that there is almost no solar radiation be-
fore 6 o'clock and after 19 o'clock, the system is operated from 6:00 to
19:00. Based on the above mentioned operating conditions, the calcu-
lated and tested values of the tank water temperature (Ts) and the accu-
mulated water production (AP) during operation time are given in Fig.
7. As it is shown, the agreements between the calculated and the tested
results are good. The relative deviations between the calculated and the
tested values of Ts and AP are within 1.9% and 4.0% respectively. There-
fore the mathematical model is reliable and could be used to study the
plant. Furthermore, during the operation, although there is a slight
rise, the electric conductivity of the produced fresh water is still basical-
ly less than 12 米S/cm, the salt rejection is also stable in the range of
99.978%每99.984%, as showed in Fig. 8. It means that the membrane

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Model validation

The validity of the present mathematical model is examined by com-
paring the simulation results with the experimental results obtained
from the test rig. There are many inuencing parameters. Optimal oper-
ating conditions including the inlet seawater, air ow rates to the hu-
midier and the packing fractions of the humidier have been found
previously [32]. Those optimal parameters are used in this study. The
structural parameters of the humidier used in this experiment are
listed in Table 2. For the size and structure of this humidier, the inlet
hot saline water ow rate is chose at 140 L/h. The ow rate is chose at

been carried over to air streams, which would subsequently condensed
into the production water. Therefore this system is a promising method
to obtain high purity water.

4.2. Evacuated solar collector performance

The solar collector is an important component of the solar powered
MHDD system. In fact, most of the driving energy for the system is col-
lected by this equipment. So its performance represents a critical factor
to the efciency of the whole system. A measure of its performance is
the collection efciency written in Eq. (5), dened as the radio of the
useful energy gain over some specied time period to the incident
solar energy. Under above operating conditions, the instantaneous col-
lector efciencies for the collector with a 4.13 m2 effective area are illus-
trated in Fig. 9. The collection efciency for this collector can be tted
linearly as a function of the parameter [(Tf,i  Te)/It]:

As shown in Eq. (47), the highest efciency of the evacuated solar
collector can reach 0.65 when the inlet water temperature of the

collector is equal to the outside environmental temperature. In general,
this U-tube evacuated solar collector has a superior energy-collecting
efciency compared with other plate solar collector or evacuated tube
collectors [33,34]. Fig. 10 shows variations of the instantaneous collector
efciency with time during operation time. The collector efciency
varies between 0.33 and 0.55 during the hours of operations and
reaches a maximum at about 10:00 am. The reason is that at 10:00 the
solar radiation is 683 W/m2 (about 85% of the noon time value) while
the temperature difference between Tf,i and Te is not so large. As a result
the ratio of temperature difference to solar radiation reaches a mini-
mum and the collector efciency attains a maximum.

4.3. Effects of water volumes in the tank

The sizes of the storage tank are simulated. The system with a 50 ∼C
initial saline water temperature is operated from 6:00 until the temper-
ature is below 50 ∼C in the afternoon. The effective collector area is
4.13m2 and other operation conditions are all specied as before.
Fig. 11 shows the effects of tank volumes on the water temperature
in the tank. The instantaneous water production rate during the opera-
tion time is shown in Fig. 12. It is observed that water temperature in
the tank uctuates in response to the daily solar insolation and ambient
temperatures. However the water temperature decreases between 6:00

and 7:00 because during this period the solar radiation is not strong
enough to meet the system demand. The fall in water temperature
also results in a reduction in the instantaneous water production rate
during 7:00每8:00 as shown in Fig. 12. The water tank temperature
reaches a maximum value from 13:00 to 15:00. The instantaneous
water production rate also reaches a maximum after half an hour
delay. Compared to the tanks of small volumes, water temperature in
a big volume tank responds slowly to the daily solar insolation. There-
fore, a big volume water tank can store more sensible heat from the in-
tense radiations at noon and it can then supply enough energy for the
system operation when the sunlight is weak. In this way, the running
time of the system with a 160 L volume tank has an extension of
2.31 h from that with a 40 L volume tank. The system can still run
even without solar energy input (after 19:00) as shown in Fig. 11.
The accumulated water production and SEC with varying water vol-
umes in the tank are plotted in Fig. 13. The Variations of COP and COPE
are plotted in Fig. 14. The systems stop running when the water temper-
ature is below 50 ∼C in the afternoon. As seen, though the system with a
160 L water volume has a longer running time than that with a 40 L
water volume, the accumulated water production is only increased by
1.5%. Longer running time means more electric energy consumption.
Therefore with the increase in water volume in the tank, the SEC

areas.

increases and COPE falls gradually as shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Since a
greater volume of water tank has a lower average water temperature
throughout the day, and a longer running time, consequently more
solar energy is used. In contrast, a weak AP increase results in a dimin-
ished COP. It can be concluded that on the one hand, a larger water
tank would be able to reduce the impact of uctuating solar energy
and to store sufcient amount of heat to drive the desalination system
when the light is weak. On the other hand there are no further benets
to increase the water tank volume above 40 L. The hollow ber mem-
brane module is specied at an area of 0.59 m2.

4.4. Effects of solar collector areas

Solar collector is the most important component of the solar heating
system. Usually the collector is the most expensive member for the solar
desalination system. So it is necessary to search the optimal value of col-
lector area for the system. In this section, the water volume in the tank is
set to 40 L and other operating conditions are set as before. Effects of col-
lector area on the water temperature in the tank are shown in Fig. 15.
The instantaneous water production rates during the operation time
are illustrated in Fig. 16. It is obvious that the collector area has a great
inuence on the performance of the system. Increasing collector area
causes signicant improvements in water temperature in the tank as
well as the instantaneous water production rates. Water temperature
with a 5.51 m2 collector area reaches as high as 77.9 ∼C at 13:00. With
a 1.38 m2 area, the maximum temperature is only about 53.6 ∼C at
14:00. As a result, the maximum instantaneous water production rate
of the former system is 3.4 times of the latter one.
The variations of AP, SEC, COP and COPE with varying collector areas
are shown in Figs. 17 and 18 respectively. It can be observed that SEC is
decreased by 16% when the area is increased from 1.38 m2 to 3.44 m2.
However with the area increasing, the SEC increases instead. The reason
is that larger collector area means more U-tube evacuated solar collec-
tors. And the latter reason causes a greater uid pressure drop, which
means more electricity consumption for centrifugal pumps. The in-
crease in the accumulated water production becomes slower with the

area increasing as shown in Fig. 17. Accordingly, the SEC has a minimum
of 10.8 kWh/m3 at 3.44 m2 collector area, when the COPE reaches a max-
imum of 63.3 as shown in Fig. 18. This is similar to the tread of the COP of
the system. When the collector area is larger than 3.44 m2, the higher
water temperature leads to more heat losses from the system to the en-
vironment. This is another reason for the decline of the COP.

4.5. Economic evaluation

In order to determine the economic feasibility of the proposed solar
powered MDHD system, an economic analysis has been made to calcu-
late the nal cost for water production (WPC) for the optimized system.
Assuming that the required fund for the system is loaned from the
bank, the annual interest payment for capital cost is obtained by multi-
plying the capital cost by an amortization factor a, which is given as:
a  i 1  i
1  i

n





where f is the plant availability and can be assumed to be 90% per year
[37,38].
Cxed, Axed, AO&M and WPC are all listed in Table 4. As seen in Table 4,
the solar collector cost contributes to around 63% of the total investment
of the system, and the annual operation and maintenance cost is only
about 28% of the total water production cost. From Table 4, the nal
cost for water production is about 16.88 $/m3, which is comparable to
other small-scale renewable energy sources-powered distillation units.
The nal cost for water production (WPC) is given. The performance is
compared to other systems in references as listed in Table 5. Even though
the cost for water production is high compared to other industrial scale
desalination technology like MSF, whose cost is $2.66/m3 [41], small
membrane-based humidication dehumidication plants like this system
are still very attractive because they are exible due to their modularity
and simplicity in operation. This system also provides an alternative desa-
lination system for remote isolated areas as a small-scale, stand-alone sys-
tem with low maintenance needs. Furthermore, considering the cost of
solar collector accounts for most of the total investment, the future devel-
opment of solar collector technology could reduce the cost of solar collec-
tor and ultimately result in reducing the water cost signicantly.

5. Conclusions

where i is the annual interest rate, n is the life time of the plant. The
values used in Eq. (48) are shown in Table 3. Also listed are other data
and assumptions used in the economic study. The operating conditions
are a 40 L heat storage tank, with a 4.13 m2 solar collector area, and a
0.59 m2 membrane module. Based on these operating conditions, the
accumulated water production (AP) is 15.85 kg/d. The SEC is only
11.79 kWh/m3, which means that this process is an energy saving alter-
native to conventional desalination processes such as MSF and RO [35,
36]. The electricity rate used here is 0.136 $/kWh, a 2015 market price
in Guangzhou.

Feasibility of a solar energy driven and membrane-based air humid-
ication dehumidication desalination (MHDD) system has been stud-
ied in this paper. A mathematical model for the whole system is built
and validated by experimental data. Both energy and economic analysis
are performed to draw following conclusions:

(1) The study conrmed that using hollow ber membrane module
as a humidier for air humidication is a promising method to
provide high purity drinkable water. During the operation time,

the electric conductivity of the produced fresh water is less than
12 米S/cm.
(2) The thermal energy storage unit plays an important role to solve
the uctuating nature of solar energy. The system can thus work
during weak sunlight hours and even in the night. However for a
system with 0.59 m2 membrane area, there are no benets to fur-
ther increase the hot water storage tank above 40 L.
(3) The accumulated water production increases signicantly with
an increase in solar collector area. The optimum ratio of the stor-
age tank volume to the effective area of solar collector is about
12 L/m2.
(4) Economic evaluation of the whole system indicates that the sys-
tem has a low maintenance cost. The water production cost is
about 16.88 $/m3, which is an acceptable price for a small-scale,
stand-alone system to provide clean potable water, especially
in remote areas or isolated islands.
