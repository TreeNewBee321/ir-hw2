abstract

In wireless sensor networks, where energy is scarce, it is inecient to have all nodes active because they 
consume a non-negligible amount of battery. In this paper we consider the problem of jointly selecting 
sensors, relays and links in a wireless sensor network where the active sensors need to communicate 
their measurements to one or multiple access points. Information messages are routed stochastically in 
order to capture the inherent reliability of the broadcast links via multiple hops, where the nodes may 
be acting as sensors or as relays. We aim at nding optimal sparse solutions where both, the consis- 
tency between the selected subset of sensors, relays and links, and the graph connectivity in the selected 
subnetwork are guaranteed. Furthermore, active nodes should ensure a network performance in a pa- 
rameter estimation scenario. Two problems are studied: sensor and link selection; and sensor, relay and 
link selection. To solve such problems, we present tractable optimization formulations and propose two 
algorithms that satisfy the previous network requirements. We also explore an extension scenario: only 
link selection. Simulation results show the performance of the algorithms and illustrate how they provide 
a sparse solution, which not only saves energy but also guarantees the network requirements.

1. Introduction 

Nowadays, wireless sensor networks are developed to pro- 
vide fast, cheap, reliable, and scalable hardware solutions for a 
large number of industrial applications, ranging from surveillance 
[1,2] and tracking [3,4] to exploration [5,6] , monitoring [7,8] , and 
other sensing tasks [9] . From the software perspective, an increas- 
ing effort is spent on designing algorithms that can provide high 
reliability with limited computation, communication, and energy 
requirements for the sensor nodes. 
In this paper, we consider a network of battery-powered sen- 
sors that take measurements related to some important environ- 
mental parameter and that need to communicate their measure- 
ments to one or multiple access points (APs), or sinks, which are 
responsible for processing the gathered information. Communica- 
tion with the APs is achieved through multihop routes dened via 
a connectivity graph which considers the sensors¡¯ communication 
range. 
Resources (mainly energy) in this network are scarce so it is 
inecient to have all sensors active. Some sensors may not be in- 
formative enough and hardly contribute to achieve a minimum de- 
sired network performance; nonetheless, if active, they would con- 
sume a non-negligible amount of resources. Moreover, communica- 
tion efforts are among the most energy demanding tasks in wire- 
less sensor networks [10] and they should be minimized by prop- 
erly selecting not only the suitable sensors but also the proper ac- 
tive links. Knowledge of the network topology should be exploited 
in order to make a better selection of the links that are in charge of 
conveying the information because information may be degraded 
over long distances and transmissions should be avoided to reduce 
energy expenditure. 
With the reduction of energy expenditure in mind, in this paper 
we consider a distributed estimation scenario in wireless sensor 
networks, where each sensor takes local measurements of a phe- 
nomenon of interest at a particular rate and communicates them 
in a multihop way to one or multiple APs. In this scenario, we 
study the problem of judiciously and consistently selecting the op- 
timal minimum set of sensors and links that ought to be active in 
the network, so that a prescribed network performance (e.g., the 
mean squared error of the estimation of the parameter of inter- 
est) as well as graph connectivity among the selected active sen- 
sors are guaranteed. Only the measurements taken by the active 
sensors must be reported back to the APs via the active sensors 
and active links. This is the reason for requiring graph connectivity 
among the selected active sensors. Moreover, the optimal sensing 
rates supported by the active sensors are calculated. We analyze 
the problem from a stochastic point of view, where information 
messages are routed stochastically thereby capturing the inherent 
reliability of the broadcast wireless links. 

1.1. State of the art 

The concept of sensor selection has been extensively studied in 
the context of parameter and state estimation. The resulting min- 
imum cardinality combinatorial problem has been tackled by us- 
ing different tools, from convex relaxations, e.g., [11¨C13] , to sub- 
modularity [14¨C16] and frame theory [17,18] . These tools have their 
pros and cons. More along the lines of this paper, in [19] not only 
is the best subset of sensors selected that communicate with the 
fusion center but also the collaboration scheme that allows each 
sensor to combine its raw measurements with those coming from 
other sensors according to certain weights. 
Stochastic routing in multihop networks has been introduced 
in the literature in order to cope with the random nature of wire- 
less links [ 20 , 21 ]. Transmissions are based on a reliability matrix, 
where each element of the matrix reects the probability of satis- 
factorily transmitting and receiving a message between two given 
sensors. In [22] , the authors dene the concept of connectivity 
within a context of mobile robotic networks in terms of commu- 
nication rates, and based on this denition, the authors propose a 
distributed algorithm to nd the optimal operating points of wire- 
less networks when the link metric is the link reliability. The work 
of [23] considers the problem of optimizing the routing and sen- 
sor selection given a total budget constraint. Yet, the approach pre- 
sented in [23] is heuristic and divides the estimation and routing 
problems, by tackling them in two separated phases, which could 
cause additional suboptimality of the solution. 
Often times, a distinction is made between sensor and relay 
nodes. Relay nodes help the source nodes (sensing nodes) in for- 
warding the messages to the APs: they receive a message from the 
source nodes, process it and forward it towards the intended APs. 
Relaying is especially benecial when there is no line-of-sight path 
between the source and the destination. This distinction between 
sensor types may be motivated, for instance, by economical rea- 
sons (relay devices may be cheaper than sensors given that their 
functionality is more limited), or by design prerequisites (sensors 
need to achieve a certain performance while relays do not be- 
cause they are only limited to forwarding the information). Previ- 
ous state-of-the-art works are only based on proposing relay selec- 
tion schemes (e.g., [24,25] , and references therein): given a source 
sensor and a sink, they try to choose the best relays among a col- 
lection of available ones based on different criteria. Other works 
are aimed at optimally placing wireless relay nodes and sinks [26] . 

1.2. Our contributions 

All the aforementioned state-of-the-art works either face the 
sensor selection problem or the stochastic routing, but what has 
never been addressed in the literature before is the challenge of 
jointly selecting the optimal minimum set of active sensors (and 
their corresponding sensing rates) which satises a prescribed es- 
timation performance metric and consistently nding the optimal 

multihop routes so that the selected subgraph is connected. Hence, 
in this paper we do not focus on devising new methods to solve 
selection problems or on comparing them, instead we are mainly 
interested in formulating a stochastic framework for consistent 
sensor and link selection. Even the closest prior work [19] , which 
is a ¡°dual¡± problem w.r.t. ours, differs from this paper in several 
ways: in [19] all sensors can directly communicate with the fusion 
center (i.e., it is not a multihop scenario so the graph connectivity 
is not a problem), communication links are established based on 
inter-sensor collaboration before transmitting a processed message 
to the fusion center, and the optimal transmission rates of trans- 
mitting sensors are not determined. 
The problem at hand becomes even more challenging when 
there is a distinction between sensor and relay nodes. In a sce- 
nario where there are the two types of nodes, we want to con- 
sistently determine which of the nodes, placed at well-determined 
positions, should play the role of sensors (and hence their sensing 
rate should be determined) and which ones the role of relays while 
guaranteeing both a prescribed network performance and connec- 
tivity in the selected subgraph. To nd an optimal solution, a joint 
source and relay selection should be performed, which implicitly 
implies to activate suitable links. ( Fig. 1 ) 
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as fol- 
lows: 

1. From a stochastic point of view and in a multihop scenario, 
we formulate a tractable optimization problem to select consis- 
tently the optimal subsets of sensors (with their sensing rates) 
and links that guarantee both, a required network performance 
and graph connectivity in the selected subnetwork. To solve 
this problem, we propose a sparsity-aware algorithm based on 
a convex relaxation ( Sections 2 ¨C4 ). 
2. The previous framework is also well-suited for the joint selec- 
tion of sensors, relays and links (which is not the case for other 
approaches in the literature, e.g., [23] ). Under a slight modica- 
tion of the previous optimization problem and applying a con- 
vex relaxation technique, we propose another sparsity-aware 
consistent sensor-relay-and-link selection algorithm. This algo- 
rithm assigns the optimal sensing rates to the active sensors 
and ensures network connectivity as well as a prescribed net- 
work performance ( Sections 5 and 6 ). 
3. Finally, we also extend the work to a special case where only 
link selection is considered ( Section 7 ). 
Contributions (1)¨C(3) rely on a reformulation of the problems 
as 
convex optimization problems. This allows for ecient and 
well performing algorithms. Different approaches, e.g. [27] , would 
yield more complex problem formulations, which rely on dedicated 
non-convex solvers. This is avoided here. In addition, based on the 
fact that a 
relaxation is leveraged, distributed algorithms can be 
envisioned (see Remark 1 ). 
Numerical simulation results support our claims and illustrate 
a satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithms. As a last 
note, we highlight that the presented algorithms are exposed in a 
static framework, i.e., given a certain network, we provide a selec- 
tion strategy. Yet, they could be implemented in a dynamical way, 
by repeating their execution, so to balance the energy level of the 
active and non-active sensors and relays (see Remark 3 ). 
Notation: Notation is where possible standard: we indicate with 
boldfaced small letters, such as x , real vectors, whereas capital 
boldfaced letters, e.g. A , represent real matrices. Vector p -norms 
are indicated with 
 p , while p -norms for matrices are intended 
element-wise , e.g., 
is the sum of the absolute values of the el- 
ements of the matrix A . Pseudo-norms, such as the 0-norm, follow 
the same notation.

2. Problem formulation 

High-level problem description: In this paper, we are facing the 
problem of consistently selecting the smallest subset of sensors 
and links out of all available ones such that a certain performance 
measure and network connectivity (which ensures a path from the 
active sensors to the APs) is guaranteed. The motivation behind se- 
lecting a low number of sensors (and subsequently, an appropriate 
reduced amount of links) comes from the need of minimizing the 
economical and communication costs in wireless sensor networks. 
Clearly, this saving should not jeopardize the performance or the 
network connectivity. Communication between the active sensors 
and the APs as well as a network performance must be guaran- 
teed. 
We consider a static wireless sensor network composed of J 
sensor nodes and K access points (APs) or sinks. At this point, we 
do not consider any relays yet. We denote with 
 K }
1 
 J}
 the set of sensors and access points, where i 
 are the indexes corresponding to the sensor nodes and 
 K }
i 
 are the indexes corresponding to the 
APs. The network topology is determined by the physical loca- 
tions of the sensors and APs, collected in the stacked vector x 
[ x 
] 
 where the vector x i 
indicates the posi- 
tion of sensor or AP i .

2.1. Communication network 

Sensors need to communicate their measurement to the APs 
in a multi-hop fashion (due to energy/power constraints). An im- 
portant feature of this paper is that we can only use active sen- 
sors to transmit messages. We model the communication qual- 
ity among sensors and APs using a link reliability metric, denoted 
)
¡Ü J ) or an AP (otherwise) receives successfully a mes- 
 which represents the probability that sen- 
sor p (if p 
sage sent from sensor i . We model this probability as a smooth 
non-increasing function with compact support, and in particular, 
¡Ý d 
(0)
(d )
R 
 1 and R 
 0 for all d 
 for a predened cut-off dis- 
tance 
d . 
The link reliability metric induces a specic undirected com- 
munication graph on the wireless sensor network: whenever R ip 
is nonzero, there is a possible link between sensor i and sensor or 
AP p . We describe this communication graph in terms of the edge 
(i,
 p)
set 
 given by 
(V ,
 and we de- 
note the graph as

where the vectors a i 
m represent the regressors, while n i 
is a 
Gaussian noise term with mean 0 and covariance 
. Sensor i ac- 
quires measurements y i 
with a rate r i 
(we assume that the max- 
imum relative rate r i 
is known and xed, while the relative rate r i 
 [0, 1] is a design parameter). If r i 
 the node will not take any 
measurements and will not be active. 
As we mentioned, the collected measurements need to be com- 
municated back to the APs in a multi-hop fashion. The APs are in 
charge of combining the measurements y i 
, coming from different 
sensors at different rates, to estimate the value of the parameter 
¦È . The quality of the estimate can be evaluated a priori based on 
which sensors are measuring (more specically their regressors a i 
and noise variances 
) and their rates. Examples of such qual- 
ity metrics are rate versions of the mean square error (MSE), the 
worst case error variance, or the volume of the condence ellip- 
soid [11] . For instance, if we select the MSE-rate as quality metric 
and assume that the noise experienced at different sensors is un- 
correlated, then we would have

where we have collected the relative rates in r

mark that if a sensor is not active, its relative rate is zero. The 
higher the value of f ( r ), the higher the MSE-rate of the estimate, 
and vice versa. Other types of function f ( r ) can be found in [11,13] , 
both for uncorrelated and correlated noise. In order to keep the 
presentation as general as possible, we will not specify which qual- 
ity metric we select: we will simply write the metric as the func- 
tion f ( r ).

2.3. Connectivity modeling 

Before formalizing the problem mathematically, we need to in- 
troduce how we will model the communication links and the in- 
duced connectivity. In this paper, we use a stochastic point of view 
and we use the stochastic routing framework of [22] . 
In our multihop wireless network, messages will be routed 
stochastically, i.e., sensor nodes select a neighbor, either a sensor 
or an AP, to forward the message according to a certain probability. 
A set of variables T ip 
 [0, 1] will denote the probability that node 
i selects node p , either a sensor or an AP, as a destination of the 

¡Ê

R. Arroyo-Valles et al. / Signal Processing 140 (2017) 32¨C44 

35 

transmitted messages. In this sense, the variables T ip 
can be seen 
as the probability that node i selects the link that joins sensors i 
¡Á (J 
 K )
and p . The matrix T , of size J 
 gathers all these probabil- 
ity values. Further, the matrix T needs to satisfy a certain number 
of constraints. First, if either one of the sensors i or p is not ac- 
tive, then T ip 
must be zero: this models the fact that if a sensor 
is not active then it cannot send or receive messages. This can be 
formulated as 

+

T i p 

=

 0 iff r i r p 

=

,

¡Ê

¡Ê

(3) 

since T ip 
will be nonzero if and only if both r i 
and r p are nonzero, 
meaning that the sensors are active (we can x r p 
 1 for APs, 
without loss of generality). Second, since we are dealing with link 
probability values, the sum of all link probabilities of an active sen- 
sor should be at most 1:

 i 

¡Ê

V

 s 

.

(4) 

We notice that we can use i 
 s in condition (4) , since non-active 
sensors have T i p 
 0 due to condition (3) , and therefore (4) is au- 
tomatically satised. 
To complete the formulation, we want to ensure the delivery of 
messages to the APs, which is achieved by guaranteeing network 
connectivity among the active sensors and APs. To that aim, let R 0 
be the transmission rate of the sensors. Then the effective trans- 
mission rate in the active link between nodes i and p is R 0 
(re- 
call that R ip 
, x p ) is the link reliability between sensors or 
APs). We consider normalized rates by making R 0 
 and we fur- 
ther assume that all sensors have the same transmission rate R 0 
, 
which is an easy-to-lift constraint. 
Each sensor stores messages in a queue between the genera- 
tion or arrival from other sensors and their transmission. An active 
sensor i , apart from generating messages locally at rate r i 
 also 
receives messages from other sensors p with an active link T pi 
. 
Thus, the aggregate rate at which messages arrive at sensor node i 
is 

¡Ê

In a similar way, the rate at which sensor i sends messages to other 
nodes p , which may be sensors or APs, is given by

If we consider that the average rate at which messages leave the

then the queue empties often with probability one and there is an 
almost sure guarantee that the messages are delivered to the AP 
[22] (a formal statement of this fact will be given in the following). 
Problem statement: Given the measurement model for the dif- 
ferent sensors and a prescribed performance measure value 
0, we want to nd the relative rates r

J , which select the 
minimum subset of sensors, and the probabilistic routing matrix

 which selects the minimum subset of links, so that

where the non-negative scalars

determine the impor-

 then the problem 
becomes link selection with stochastic routing, while for 
the problem is sensor selection. We denote as ( r 
, T 
) any optimal 
couple determined by the solution of problem (8). 
We can readily notice that (8) is a nonconvex program, which 
makes nding any optimal couple ( r 
, T 
) computationally expen- 
sive in practice. In this paper, we are interested in nding an ap- 
proximate solution of (8) by a suitable convex relaxation.

With the assumption that the now continuous function f : R 
R is convex in r (as it happens with all the aforementioned qual- 
ity measurement examples [11] ), then the program (10) is convex. 
In addition, for the mentioned examples of f ( r ), (10) is a semidef- 
inite program, which makes its solution ecient to compute poly- 
(
)
nomially with off-the-shelf software. We indicate with 
 any 
possible solution of (10). 
(
It is important to note that the couple 
 is only an approx- 
imation of the sought solution ( r 
, T 
). However, we will see in 
the simulation section that 
(
)
 is usually a sparsely enough ap- 
proximate solution. An additional feature of the approximate cou- 
ple 
(
)
 is that it is feasible w.r.t. the constraint set of the origi- 
nal problem (8), and therefore it does not have to be mapped into 
a different set (as it usually happens in relaxed sensor selection 
problems). The reason for this is that we are working with rates 
and not Boolean variables. 
A strategy to increase the sparsity of the approximate couple 
)
 which has been proposed in [28] , is to use a reweighted 
minimization mechanism. In this paper, we also use this strategy, 
which goes as follows. Consider the relaxed problem (10), with the 
different cost function 
 where w 
and W 
 are a weighting vector and matrix, respectively. 
The weights can be determined so to push small components of r 
and T to zero, and boost big ones to one. In particular, initialize

Connectivity guarantees of Algorithm 1 : We notice that due 
to (7) , the solution coming from Algorithm 1 guarantees that the 
measurements acquired at the sensors are delivered at the APs, i.e., 
each of the active sensors has a path back to at least one AP. To 
formally prove this statement, consider (7) :

this constraint has to be true for each active sensor (the one for 
¡Ü 0 for the not active ones (due to 
which r i

constraint (9) , i.e., in this case also T pi 
are 0). Since it has 
to be true for all active sensors, each of them has to send out more 
rate than what it receives (and the difference is given by its mea- 
surement rate), that is

Therefore, rst: no active sensor can be a sink (it has to send out 
more than it receives). Second: there cannot be loops of active sen- 
sors not connected to a sink. In fact, if there were, since the rate 
augments along the loop, constraint (7) would not be satised for 
at least a pair of active sensors connected together. Thus, the only 
possibility is that eventually each sensor has a path to a sink. This 
is also what we observe in simulations.

Remark 1. (Distributed algorithms) Although the algorithms in this 
paper are centralized, one could devise distributed algorithms in 
a standard fashion. For instance, Problems (10) and (19) with the 
choice for f ( r ) of (2) t the general structure presented in [29] . In 
particular one needs to consider the local decision variables x i 
as 
)
the vector 
 . In this case, with the use of consensus- 
based dual decomposition each sensor could decide their on/off
strategy and to whom to communicate. Nonetheless, rst, the re- 
weighting procedure is not trivial to implement in this case, and 
second, the sensors could spend a considerable amount of battery 
power to decide their on/off strategy. We believe that developing 

(r i 

,

{

 T i p 

}

 p¡ÊV

 s 

distributed and yet ecient (i.e., power-aware) algorithms for sen- 
sor selection is still an open research area, which is left for future 
investigations. 

Remark 2. (Stochasticity of the reliability matrix R ip 
) Although here 
we assume to know each element R ip 
in a deterministic sense, one 
could also think of estimating R ip 
online. If then one possesses a 
pdf for R ip 
, one could replace the deterministic constraint (7) with 
a stochastic variant of it. Another approach in the estimation 
would be the one of [30] . Finally, a third approach would consider 
a time-varying online algorithm to track R ij 
as it (possibly) varies 
in time, which is in line with the research proposed in [31] . 

Remark 3. (Energy eciency) Energy eciency can also be consid- 
ered in the proposed approach. For instance, one could re-run the 
selection algorithm to take into account that the battery charge of 
the devices has changed, so to keep a balance in the usage of the 
whole sensor network. A way to include battery charge into the 
optimization problem is, e.g., to initialize the weights w 
¡¯s not to 1 
but to the inverse of the battery level: 1 if fully charged, 
 if out 
of charge.

4. Numerical results for sensors and links 

In this section, we assess the performance of the proposed SSLS 
algorithm in terms of the amount of resources that are used, i.e., 
the number of both, active sensors and links. We also verify the 
consistency and the subgraph connectivity. 
We consider an estimation scenario where sensors are ran- 
domly deployed according to a uniform distribution in a square 
area of side 5 units. The regression matrix, A

 is drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with vari-

SNR 
 where SNR is set to 0 dB. We use the cost f ( r ) of (2) and 
¦Ã in (11d) to 0.5. The link reliability metric that 
set the parameter 
we use in the simulations is given by:

¦Â the power attenuation factor (2 
with 
munication radius. We have considered 
 2 and d 
 74 [32] . 
The number of iterations in the reweighted 
minimization is 
empirically set to 30 to trade-off sparsity of the solution and com- 
putational time. Due to the application of the reweighted 
min- 
imization mechanism, only the sensors and links with relatively 
high acquisition rate and link probability are active. We round off
to 0 the link probabilities and sensor rates lower than a suciently 
¡¤ 10 
4 . Further, we consider 
¦Ä , which is set to 
small constant 
 1 . Notice that rounding off the probabilities to 0 could 
incur in a loss of connectivity. This is however not likely in prac- 
tice, due to the reweighting procedure that makes sure that the 
non-zero probabilities have values well above the selected thresh- 
¦Ä . The experimental results support this claim, since we have 
old 
not witnessed any loss in connectivity. 
Fig. 2 is an example of a 100-node sensor network with a single 
AP. The parameter to estimate has dimension m 
 2 and the max- 
imum rate is r 
 7 . Active sensors are colored in green while the 
AP is in black. The results show the sparsity of the solution since 
only a few sensors (4%) and links (0.072%) are active. It can be also 
seen that the selected subgraph is connected and there is always 
a path between the active sensors and the AP. The solution also 
satises the other constraints of the optimization problem. Fig. 3 
shows the relative rates of the active sensors. 
Next, our purpose is to show average performance results. 
Hence, we run 250 Monte Carlo simulations for each network con- 
guration. The number of deployed sensors, J , varies from 30 to

100 and there is one AP. Two values of r are considered, 0.4 and 
0.7. Simulations are run considering that r is identical for all nodes 
in the sensor network. Also, we consider two values for the dimen- 
sion of the parameter to estimate, m 
 2 and m 
 4 . Two metrics 
are considered to assess the performance of the networks. They try 
to measure the amount of resources that are used in the network. 
Since we are dealing with acquisition rates, let us rst dene 
the total relative acquisition rate of the whole network as the sum 
of the acquisition rates of the sensors in the network, i.e., 
 r 
. 
In order to make the performance measurement independent of 
the number of sensors in the network, we dene the percentage 
of the total relative acquisition rate of the whole network, P trr , as

Note that only active sensors and APs contribute to the sum, 
since the remaining link probabilities are 0. In this case, the metric 
is related to the percentage of active links in the network. In both 
cases, the lower the metrics are, the fewer resources (in terms of 
active sensors and links) are used. 
Figs. 4 and 5 show the average performance and the standard 
deviation for m 
 2 and m 
 respectively, for different amounts 
of deployed sensors and the two values of r . Even for the worst 
case scenario, i.e., for r 
 4 and a 30-node network, the P trr 
values are 8% and 5.5% for m 
 2 and 22% and 17% for 
m 
 respectively (which represents a small percentage of used 
resources). 
In order to verify if those metric values correspond to the ac- 
tivation of a low number of sensors with high relative rate values 
or correspond to a high number of active sensors with low rela- 
tive rate values, Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate the average percentage of

later increases slightly starting from networks of 80 nodes. Even 
though networks with 80¨C100 nodes have between 6% to 8% of ac- 
tive nodes (i.e., 7 sensors), those networks have a slightly higher 
amount of active resources than in networks of 30 nodes (10%, ap- 
proximately 3 nodes). However, in general, the total number of ac- 
tive sensors stay low in comparison to the total number of sensors, 
which corroborates the sparsity of the solution.

Let us analyze the behavior of the metrics for r 
 4 and m 
(analogous conclusions are raised for networks with m 
 4 ). In 
Fig. 4 , P trr values decrease from 7.5% at networks of 30 nodes 
to 2.7% at networks of 70 nodes, and from that point increases 
slightly up to a value of 3.2% at networks of 100 nodes. If we now 
have a look at Fig. 6 , the percentage of active sensors goes from 
11.8% at 30-node networks (i.e., 3.5 sensors) to 8% at 50-node net- 
works (i.e., 4 sensors) and later increases until reaching a value of 
22% at 90-node networks (i.e., 20 nodes). While the number of ac- 
tive nodes is similar in networks with a low amount of sensors 
(30¨C50 nodes), it increases slightly for denser networks (60¨C100 
nodes). In this latter case, sensors are closer to each other so that 
the reliability values among sensors are similar and more sensors 
may be activated. First, although not reported here, we have ob- 
served that increasing the number of reweighting iterations does 
help in the latter case in reducing the amount of active sensors, at 
the cost of increasing the computational time requirements. Sec- 
ond, we will see how this is not an issue when relays are consid- 
ered. 
In case of the percentage of active links, the values are below 
0.7% for m 
 2 and 2% for m 
 4 for all the network sizes. Hence, 
the networks are sparse in the amount of active links. 
From the gures, it can be appreciated that, for a given num- 
ber of nodes, the percentage of used resources is lower in case of 
estimating a parameter of 2 dimensions than one of 4 dimensions 
(compare the metric values as well as the percentage of active sen- 
sors and links). Furthermore, the percentage of used resources (ac- 
tive sensors and links) is lower in case of considering r 
Subgraph connectivity and consistency have been also checked 
for every run. All the activated sensors have a path to the AP. Fur- 
thermore, connectivity of the network in the sense of (7) is guar- 
anteed.

5. Sensor and relay selection 

When dealing with wireless sensor networks which are de- 
ployed in large areas, it is often useful to employ relays to facil- 
itate the transmission of measurements back to the APs. In this 
spirit, we also consider the possible presence of relays. In partic- 
ular, from here on, all the nodes deployed in the sensor network 
may act as sensors or as relays. Note that sensors can also act as 
a relay while sensing, as discussed in the previous section. Our 
goal is to consistently determine which of the nodes, which are 
placed at well-dened positions, should play the role of sensors 
and which ones the role of relays while guaranteeing both a pre- 
scribed network performance and connectivity in the selected sub- 
graph. Notice that relays have less energy requirements that sen- 
sors, and therefore the distinction between sensors and relays is 
benecial to further reduce the overall energy consumption. No- 
tice also that, as expressed in the introduction, the proposed solu- 
tion may be reiterated in time, to assign different roles at different 
times. 
In order to model the possibility for a node to be acting as 
a sensor or as a relay, we introduce a new Boolean variable 
 and we dene that a node i 
 a sensor or relay, is on 
 1 and it is off, otherwise ( 
 1 for APs). From the nodes

active sensors and links. For networks of 30 nodes and r 
 the 
average percentage of active sensors and links is 12% (i.e., 3.6 sen- 
sors) and 0.55% for m 
 2 and 30% (i.e., 9 sensors) and 1.7% for 
m 
 respectively. Thus, this result corroborates that the amount 
of used resources is conservative, i.e., there is a low percentage of 
active sensors with high relative rates because the P trr values are 
the highest in Figs. 4 and 5 .

From Figs. 4 and 5 it can be seen that the values of the two 
metrics decrease with the increase of the number of sensors (re- 
gardless of m ), reaching lower values than those of the network of 
30 nodes. 
Let us examine the scenario with m 
 2 (analogous conclusions 
hold for networks with m 
 4 ). If we also analyze the trend in 
the percentage of active sensors ( Fig. 6 ), it rst decreases and

as the relays can exchange information. Notice that the constraint 
has a simplied form w.r.t. (3) , since the variable

addition, we need a constraint that makes sure that a sensor has a 
positive relative rate only when its node is activated, that is

In Algorithm 2 , we summarize the procedure for consistent 
sparse sensor, relay, and link selection (SSRLS), where we have 
used once again the sparse-enhancement procedure of reweight- 
ing. 
Connectivity guarantees of Algorithm 2 : We formalize now the 
claim that from each active sensor there exists a path (formed 
by relays and other active sensors) that goes to an AP. The ar- 
gument that we use to prove this claim is the same as the 
one that we have used to prove the connectivity guarantees of 
Algorithm 1 (where no relay were considered). Consider (17) : this 
constraint has to be true for each active sensor and active relay 
¡Ü 0 for the 
(the one for which r i 
 0 and 
 0), and it reads 0 
not active ones (due to constraints (15) and (16) ). Since it has to 
be true for all active sensors and relays, the sensors have to send 
out more rate than what they receive (and the difference is given 
), while the relays can send out exactly what they receive. 
Therefore, rst: no active sensor or relay can be a sink. Second: 
there cannot be loops containing active sensors not connected to 
a sink, since the rate augments along the loop and (17) would not 
be satised for at least one pair of connected active elements (ei- 
ther sensor¨Csensor, sensor¨Crelay, or relay¨Crelay). Third: there can- 
not be loops containing only active relays. The reason for the last 
claim is that, although (17) would be satised along the loop for 
for all pairs of active relays ( i, p ) on the loop, the so- 
lution T i p 
 0 is the optimal one, given the selected cost function. 
Which induces all the relays in the loop to become inactive. Thus, 
the only possibility is that eventually each sensor has a path to a 
sink, and no relays are used without purpose.

6. Numerical results with relays 

Similarly to the sensor and link selection scenario, in this sec- 
tion we assess the performance of the new SSRLS algorithm in 
terms of the amount of resources that are used. We also verify the 
consistency and the subgraph connectivity.

Once again, we consider an estimation scenario, where the pa- 
3 as those used in the sensor and link se- 
rameters are the same 
lection case ( Section 4 ). We consider 
 1 . Fig. 8 is an 
example of a 50-node sensor network with two APs with m 
and r 
 4 . The active sensors are colored in green, the active re- 
lays in blue and the APs are colored in black. Looking at the g- 
ure, it is evident that the obtained solution is sparse. From the 50 
nodes (excluding the APs), 5 are selected as sensors and 3 as re- 
lays. The amount of active links (i.e., those that have a probability 
value higher than 0) is 8%. Observe the connectivity of the selected 
subgraph, where there is a path from each active sensor to the APs 
via the relays, where messages are routed stochastically according 
to the link probability. The solution also satises the other con- 
straints of the optimization problem. 
Next, and following a parallel analysis to the one made in the 
sensor and link selection scenario, we show average performance 
results. The number of sensors varies from 30 to 100, r is 0.4 or 
0.7 and m is either 2 or 4. 250 Monte Carlo simulations are run 
for each network conguration. The metrics to assess the network 
performance are the ones exposed in Section 4 . To check the spar- 
sity in the number of relays, we also evaluate the percentage of 
active relays in the network. 
Figs. 9 and 10 show the average performance and the standard 
deviation, for m 
 2 and m 
 respectively, for different num- 
bers of deployed sensor nodes and the two values of the maxi- 
mum acquisition rate. From these gures it can be seen that the 
values decrease when the number of sensor nodes in- 
creases, going from a value of 6.3% ( m 
 r 
 4 ) or 19% ( m 
r 
 4 ) for networks of 30 nodes to values lower than 2% ( m 
r 
 4 ) or 5% ( m 
 r 
 4 ) for networks of 100 nodes. To verify 
if those metric values correspond to the activation of a few sen- 
sors with high relative rate value, Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate the av- 
erage percentage of active sensors and links. For r 
 the av- 
erage percentage of sensors goes from approximately 8% (i.e., 2.4

networks to around 2% (i.e., 2 sensors for m 
 2 ) or 5% (i.e., 5 sen- 
sors for m 
 4 ) in 100-node networks, respectively. Fig. 13 also il- 
lustrates the percentage of active relays for sensor networks of dif- 
ferent sizes, r and m . For m 
 4 and r 
 2 relays (or 5.5% of 
the nodes) are active in 30-sensor networks, while 1 relay (0.9%) 
is active in 100-sensor networks. 
The conclusions from these gures are two-fold: First, indepen- 
dently of the total number of available nodes, the algorithm ro- 
bustly selects a similar number of sensors, relays and links to sat- 
isfy the constraint on the measurement errors. This strongly sug- 
gests that the optimality of the sensing, given the constraints, is 
achieved. Second, the active sensors are those with high relative 
rates. And even more, we obtain sparse solutions not only in the 
amount of active sensors but also in the amount of active links and 
relays. 
As observed for the sensor and link selection scenario, the de- 
mand of resources (percentage of active sensors, links and relays) 
is less when considering higher maximum rates (see Figs. 11 ¨C13 ). 
Also, for a given number of nodes, the amount of used resources 
grows whenever the dimension of the parameter to estimate in-

creases. Besides, the variability in the results of the sensor, relay 
and link selection problem is lower than in the sensor and link se- 
lection problem. This can be observed by taking into account the 
standard deviation in the gures. All in all, it appears that when 
one considers also the presence of relays, one obtains better per- 
formance in terms of reduced active resources than in the case of 
no relays. A more in depth characterization is left as future re- 
search. 
Therefore, the SSRLS algorithm provides a consistent solution 
to the sensor and relay selection problem by always nding a con- 
nected path among the active sensors, relays and APs no matter 
the size of the network and the dimension m of the parameter to 
estimate, and which satises the network performance constraint 
for the active sensors. 
However, the following question may arise: are the active sen- 
sors obtained after solving the SSRLS algorithm the same as those 
that would be active in a problem which aims at selecting the min- 
imum number of sensors and their corresponding acquisition rates 
to satisfy a certain MSE-rate, i.e., solve the relaxed version of the 
¡Ü ¦Ã , where 
following problem: minimize r 
subject to f ( r ) 
¦Ä (have an acquisition rate different from 
sensors that satisfy r i 
0) are selected? 
Clearly, the answer is no. As an example, compare the active 
sensors in Figs. 14 and 15 , for a one-AP 100-sensor network where 
m 
 4 and r 
 7 . The solution provided by the SSRLS algorithm 
not only takes into account the sensors with the highest acquisi- 
tion rates (to satisfy the MSE-rate constraint), but also selects in 
a robust, coherent and consistent way relays and probability links 
such that the active sensors are connected to the APs (it consid- 
ers the sensor deployment, too). On the contrary, the solution pro- 
vided by the sensor selection problem does not consider the spa- 
tial distribution of sensors, and the only issue that matters is the 
selection of the sensors with the best acquisition rates. Obviously, 
this does not mean that both solutions do not activate some com- 
mon sensors. In the previous example, sensors with indexes 26, 49, 
74 and 93 are selected in both solutions.

7. Link selection 

This last scenario is a particular case of the general one where 
we assume that all sensors are active, acquire measurements with 
relative rate at least r i 0 
, and communicate with the APs in a multi- 
hop fashion. The problem that remains is to determine the proba- 
bilistic routing matrix T , that selects the minimum subset of links 
so that a certain constraint is satised. In particular, we want to 
ensure network integrity, dened according to [22] as the ability 
of the network to support the desired communication rates in a 
certain network topology. 
As in the general scenario, the network needs to satisfy the ow 
inequality constraint given by (7) in order to guarantee that mes- 
sages are delivered to the APs. Furthermore, it is also required that 
sensors communicate their measurements with the APs at a nom- 
inal rate of r i 0 
messages per time unit. This means that the rel- 
ative acquisition rate should satisfy the following inequality: r i 
. Thus, we aim at nding the appropriate relative rates r 
 [0, 
J and the sparse probabilistic routing matrix T .

The network¡¯s objective function to be optimized is the so- 
cial utility value of the optimization variables, U i 
) for the rel- 
ative rate r i 
) for the links T ip 
, which is dened as 
U (r i

 . Following [22] , we measure the 
utility value associated to the rate as U (r i

izes small rates r i

The objective function is strictly concave and the constraints 
are linear inequalities, so the problem can be solved eciently by 
using convex optimization tools. Note that the optimal utility de- 
pends on the spatial conguration of the sensors, and consequently 
the optimal link probabilities and rate variables do too, which are 
denoted as r 
 and T 
. 
The amount of selected links depends on parameter 
¦Á , which 
controls the sparsity level (the higher it is, the fewer links are se- 
lected). In order to increase sparsity and avoid the tuning of pa- 
¦Á , we apply the iterative reweighted 
rameter 
minimization al- 
gorithm only to the third term of the objective function (we call 
this partial reweighted 
minimization), which diminishes the in- 
uence of that parameter and helps in the link selection process. 
We round off to 0 the link probabilities lower than a suciently

In the remaining of this section, we show the performance of 
the link selection scheme. Fig. 16 is an example of a 50-node sen- 
sor network with one AP. Sensors are colored in red and the AP 
in black. The nominal rate is r i 0 
 which is identical for all 
the sensor nodes; another weighting parameter is

rest of the parameters are identical to those dened in Section 4 .

matter the size of the network and the dimension of the param- 
eter to estimate. This ensures the compliance of the network per- 
formance constraint by the selected sensors. 
Future work will consider the study of these algorithms from a 
decentralized point of view, eliminating the need of having an AP 
that collects all the measurements. The application of these algo- 
rithms to other scenarios is also a matter of further studies.

Fig. 17. Average percentage of total active links and its standard deviation for dif- 
ferent number of sensor nodes, and when link probabilities are graded in different 
ranges. 

The color and the thickness of the links are related to the rout- 
ing probability values, which are graded into different ranges. Blue 
links have a probability value between 
¦Ä and 0.25 and their line is 
the nest. The red ones have a probability between 0.25 and 0.5, 
the black links between 0.5 and 0.75 and the green ones between 
0.75 and 1, having the thickest line. 
Note that only 51 links are active (i.e., it is a sparse solution). 
Every sensor is connected via multiple hops (links that connect the 
sensors) to the AP, where the links with higher probabilities are 
always established between the AP and some of its neighboring 
nodes. This is logical given that a message that has been routed 
through multiple sensors should have a higher probability of arriv- 
ing successfully to the AP. In general, the sensors which are placed 
far from the AP tend to establish links with low probability values. 
Fig. 17 illustrates the average percentage of active links (the to- 
tal percentage and the percentage by probability ranges) for sensor 
networks composed of a number of sensors whose amount varies 
between 30 and 100 and r i 0 
 2 . 250 Monte Carlo simulations are 
run for each network conguration. First, the gure shows the low 
amount of active links, so that the matrix T is sparse. For 30-node 
networks, the average percentage of active links is slightly higher 
than 5 %. The percentage values decrease whenever the number of 
nodes in the network increases. Regarding the different probability 
ranges, the highest percentage of active links corresponds to values 
between 
¦Ä and 0.25, and it is followed by links with prob- 
abilities T ij 
between 0.75 and 1. As in the earlier example, most 
of those links are established between the AP and its neighbors, 
which ensures that messages arrive to the AP.

8. Conclusions 

In this paper we have proposed two optimization methods for 
selecting optimally and consistently the minimum set of sensors 
(and their corresponding sensing rates) and links (and their link 
probability values); or sensors, relays and links, in wireless sen- 
sor networks. The chosen scenario has been parameter estimation, 
where the selected sensors have to guarantee a prescribed network 
performance based on the MSE-rate. Numerical results showed the 
sparsity of the solution, which translates into a smart use of the 
network resources. The proposed algorithms have provided a con- 
sistent solution to the selection problem by always nding a con- 
nected path among the selected set of sensors, relays and APs no
