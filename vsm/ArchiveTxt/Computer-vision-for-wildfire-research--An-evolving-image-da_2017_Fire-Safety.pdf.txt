abstract

The last decade has witnessed the use of computer vision for wildre detection and measurement. The rst and
most important step for computer vision analysis is the re pixel detection because it determines the accuracy of
the following processing. The evaluation and the comparison of the wildre detection algorithms of the literature
and the development of new ones needs open datasets with a large number of annotated images and their ground
truth. We address this issue by presenting a publicly evolving wildre annotated image database with ground
truth data with examples of use. Currently, it contains 500 visible images and, in a more limited number,
multimodal images and videos with frame by frame annotations. This is currently the largest dataset released in
this research eld.

1. Introduction
Wildres are among the major risks to humans and wildlife around
the world [1每4]. Thus, efcient re detection and behavior anticipation
systems play an important role in the reduction of destruction caused by
res. The last decade has witnessed the use of computer vision for ef-
cient re detection [5每7], early re suppression [8每10], re measure-
ment, and re behavior analysis and prediction [11每13]. The rst and
most important step for computer vision analysis is the re pixel detec-
tion because it determines the accuracy of the following processing.
Fire emits radiations in a large spectral band (0:4; 14 米m). The
visible domain (0:4; 0:7 米m) is the reference domain used in wildland
re research because of the operational simplicity of visible cameras,
their very affordable price, and the large quantity of published work
using this spectrum. Fire pixel detection on color images is a challenging
task because the images are highly affected by the environmental and
physical conditions. The main difculties encountered by the detection
methods are due to re color and the presence of smoke. Indeed, the color
can be inhomogeneous (varying from yellow to red color), can have
different luminance (depending on the background and the luminosity),
and the smoke can mask the re areas. Several re detection algorithms
working with color images are proposed in the literature [14]. A rst
category of methods uses color rules. The most commonly used color

system is RGB [15每20]. Other systems are also exploited. Among these
systems are those permitting the extraction of luminance-chrominance
components, such as YCbCr [21每23], YUV [24] and L a b [25]. There
are also works using so-called cylindrical systems such as TSI [26] and
TSV [27]. Finally, some algorithms use combinations of different color
spaces [28,29]. A second category of pixel re detection algorithms uses
machine learning [17,19,21,29,30]. These detections need to learn from
a dataset containing re pixels and non re pixels obtained from a
sampling of the test image database. In this case, it is important to have a
database including a large number of heterogeneous re color images. To
complete this part, several re detection algorithms use motion analysis
[22] to consider or delete re pixel candidates selected using color
criteria. Three works present the comparison of the performances of re
pixel detection algorithms on datasets of wildre images [17,23,31]. In
Refs. [17,23], the images used to benchmark the methods are mainly
from two web databases (ForestryImages.org [32] and WildlandFire.com
[33]). As there is no a public ground truth (re contour area obtained
manually) associated with each image in these databases, it is impossible
to evaluate independently the metrics and the algorithms used in these
works. Moreover, the number of different wildre images of these da-
tabases
is
insufcient
to obtain a wildre pixel
representative
learning dataset.
Infrared images are easier to process than visible images because the
intensity of the re pixels is much higher than the one of the other pixels
[11]. The approach to detect the re zones in an infrared image is to nd
the threshold that differentiates the pixels belonging to the re to those
of the background. Several threshold search algorithms that can be
applied to the detection of re pixels are proposed in the literature
[5,34每36]. The difculty to consider infrared images is that areas similar
to those of re corresponding to hot gases can also be present in the
images and consequently can produce a difference between the re areas
appearing in the visible domain and those of the infrared domain. Works
developed by Rossi et al. [37] show that the near infrared domain
(0:75; 0:9 米m) produces wildre areas that are very similar to the ones
obtained in the visible domain. Tacking into account the fact that it is
easier to detect re pixel in infrared images but that the visible images
remains the reference, new re pixel detection algorithms could be
develop by using image fusion [38].
The development of the research on wildland re pixel detection al-
gorithms needs a publicly available database containing a large number
of images of wildre, showing various dominant re color, conditions of
smoke, environments, background,
luminosity characteristics, other
similar to re color elements (cars or reghters for example), and
ground truth data. Thus, it is important to be able to evaluate the
robustness of a criterion of pixel detection or of an overall method ac-
cording to isolated parameters like the dominant color or the texture of
the re, the presence and the type of smoke, the background luminosity
or the presence of objects that can produce error detections. Similarly,
the comparison of the performances of different algorithms must be done
considering common criteria and publicly ground truth. Finally, in order
to develop new algorithms based on image fusion and pixels movements,
multi-modal images and sequences of wildre have to be also present in
this database. In this sense, the present work aims to bring a public test
database called Corsican Fire Database (CFDB) and presents its use. The
dataset consists of 500 visible images of wildre collected worldwide,
100 multi-modal (visible and near infrared) images, and 5 sequences of
about 30 multi-modal images of outdoor experimental res captured by
the authors. Each image is associated with a black and white (binary)
ground-truth image, annotations and descriptors. This database is an
evolving one, as its content increases with the images that are depos-
ited online.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives information about
publicly re image datasets. Section 2.1 informs about the origin of the
visible images of the Corsican Fire Database, their selection and the
acquisition protocol of the multi-modal re images and sequences. Sec-
tion 2.2 presents the scheme of the manual annotation of the full
collection of the database and the descriptors obtained by using image
processing. Section 2.3 describes the handling of the new database. The
way by which the data associated to the images are made available is
described. Information is also given concerning how users of the database
can create their own test subset selections for their specic research
purposes. Finally, the conclusion appears in Section 4 with a summary of
the main characteristics of this database and the prospects for its future
extensions.

2. Wildland re image dataset

Our research has shown that there was no large public database for
wildland re images. The vast majority of the research uses Internet
collected images [32,33] or in house developed datasets of re images
non-available publically. This makes it very difcult to benchmark the
different algorithms developed for the study of forest res. A recent work
by Bedo et al. [39] permitted the development of a Flickr-based Fire
database. It contains about two thousand pictures; half of them have re
ames in different environments (vegetation, urban, car, etc.). These
images were taken from Flickr (a web site for picture and video sharing).
The database is under the Creative Commons license that guarantees free
public use. Each image has been annotated manually as §re§ or §non
re§ by seven human experts but no specic information about the re

pixels areas is given.
Another database is Dyntex [40]. This database is very well organized
and its contents properly characterized. It offers a collection of six hun-
dred and fty high quality dynamic video texture sequences. The se-
quences contain images of size 720  576, with a frame rate of 25 images
per second, and a duration of at least ten seconds. Each sequence comes
with general information (name, date, place, etc.), information about
acquisition conditions (camera settings, indoor or outdoor) as well as
information about the image texture properties in the sequence (dynamic
and spatial properties). However, this database does not contain wild-
land res.
Considering what was interesting in the cited datasets and what was
to improve, the Corsican Fire Database was developed. It contains images
captured in the visible and near infrared spectrum, video sequences,
annotation and details about the image characteristics, the environment,
etc. Additionally it was built to be an evolving database ready for outside
contributions.

2.1. Origin of the images

In order to build the database, a call for wildland re images was
made and more than 2000 images captured on the visible spectra were
collected from partners and researchers. These images came from
different parts of the world, have different formats and were acquired
from cameras with different parameters. 500 images were selected in this
set in order to have heterogeneous re colors and textures, environments,
light conditions and vegetation. For each image, a ground truth was built
with a manual segmentation of the re in the image by an expert. This
part of the database was used in Ref. [30].
The database also contains 100 multi-modal re images and 5 multi-
modal sequences of re in propagation. The multi-modal images were
obtained using the JAI AD-080GE camera. This prism based 2-CCD multi-
spectral camera acquires simultaneously an image in the visible spectra
and an image in the near infrared (NIR) spectra (700 nm - 900 nm)
through the same optic. An example of visible and near infrared images
taken simultaneously is shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). The multi-modal
images obtained directly from the JAI AD-080GE camera are not
aligned due to the fact that the visible and NIR sensors are not exactly co-
aligned. An image registration based on homography matrix transform
computation was done in order to align multi-modal images that are
available in the database. The camera shutter time was chosen according
to the environment luminosity and the focal length was set to 6 mm. The
sequences were kept with a frame rate of 1 fps. Images of both spectrum
have a size of 1024  768 pixels.
All the images of the database are in a lossless png format.

2.2.

Image descriptors

Each image of the database is annotated using several descriptors.
Some of them were annotated manually and others automatically using
an image processing procedure. The descriptors are divided into two
main categories, global descriptors and re and environment descriptors. The
annotations have two purposes: (i) they can assist users in retrieving
particular properties; for example, res with a particular Color or Texture
and (ii) it allows the user to quickly tailor test sets for specic research
purposes; for example, to test or develop detection algorithms for specic
re conditions. A number of tools to assist in this selection process are
described in Section 5. Some descriptors are missing if this information
was not given by the image owner.

2.2.1. Global descriptors
The global descriptors give general information on the image. They
are listed and described in Table 1. They are separated in two sub-groups,
General information and acquisition settings.
The General
information are administrative descriptors such as a
unique identier, the sequence number and the image number in the

Another annotations list information on location and date. The last de-
scriptors of this sub-group give the names of the visible image, the
associated infrared image (if it exists) and the ground truth image.
The Acquisition settings elds give information about the equipment
and settings used to obtain the images: the descriptor < Material > gives
the camera model used, < Focal > indicates
its
focal
length,
< Sensibility > presents its ISO sensitivity and < Exposure > contains the
exposure time used.
If an infrared image is associated to a visible image, the eld
< Spectra > indicates its spectral domain: near-infrared (NIR), short
wavelength infrared (SWIR), medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) or
long wavelength infrared (LWIR).

2.2.2. Fire and environment descriptors
The purpose of the proposed database is to specify the different pa-
rameters of the re and the environment that can be important for
detection purposes. These annotations are listed in Table 2 and are
separated in two groups. The Fire descriptors group concerns the anno-
tations specic to re pixels and the Background descriptors group is about
environment pixels. Most of these data were computed automatically
with image processing algorithms and the ground truth images. The
description and the computation of these descriptors are explained in
the following.
Concerning the Fire descriptors:
The < Occupation > eld is the percentage of re pixels in the image.
It is computed by dividing the number of re pixels (pixels labeled §re§

in the ground truth image) by the total number of pixels of the image. In
Table 2, 0  100 indicates that this indicator is between 0 and 100.
The < Color > eld indicates the dominant color of re pixels in the
image. The possible value of this descriptor is Red, Orange, Yellow-White
and Other. Each re pixel is labeled to one of these colors using the HSI
color space (see Ref. [31] for computation details). The dominant color is
the color of the majority of re pixels. An example of images of the
database CFDB with different principal color is shown in Fig. 2.
The < Smoke Superposition > eld indicates the percentage of re
pixels which are superimposed with smokes. A learning has been done
with support vector machine in order to automatically classify re pixels
with and without smoke. The smoke pixels that not superimpose re are
not considered since only re pixels given by the ground truth are pro-
cessed. The eld < ColorSmoke > indicates the color of the smoke. Its
value can be Black, Grey or White and is annotated manually.
The < Texture > eld indicates if the re is textured or not accord-
ingly to the entropy of re pixels (see Ref. [31] for computation details).
The value ※0§ informs that the re is not textured and the value ※1§ in-
dicates that it is textured. For example, the re area that appears in Fig. 2
(b) is considered textured unlike the re region that appears in the
Fig. 2 (c).
The < Dist F/C > eld gives an indication on the distance from the
re with respect to the camera. Its value can be near or far. A re is
considered near to the camera when the distance is lower than 200
meters. This eld is completed manually, given by the owner of the
image from observation or eld measurement.
The < Direction > eld indicates the direction of the re compared to
the camera. This eld is completed manually and given by the owner of
the image. The possible values are: right,
left, moves close and
moves away.
Concerning the background descriptors:
The eld < Luminosity > gives an information relating to the
brightness of the environment. An automatic procedure computes an

average of channel I of HSI color space of the non-re pixels (see Ref. [31]
for computation details). The value of this eld is a value between 0 and
100. Fig. 3 shows three images that have different luminosity values.
The following descriptors are annotated manually.
The eld < Time > indicates if the picture has been captured during
the day or the night.
The < Vegetation > eld gives information about the vegetable fuel
that appears in the image. The possible values are: crimp wood, low
maquis shrubland, high maquis shrubland and trees.
The < Presence > descriptor indicates the presence of potential false
positives area like the ones corresponding to re men or trucks.
Finally the eld < Clouds > indicates if clouds are visible in the sky
that can also generate false re detections especially when processing
infrared images. The value ※1§ indicates the presence of clouds and the
value ※0§ their absence.

heterogeneity of the pixels in the dataset.

2.3. Database on internet

The Corsican Fire Database is available online at the following URL:

out by considering three sub-intervals that are: [0每20] (low), ]20每45]
(medium) and ]45每100] (high).
The lower part of Fig. 4 shows part of the list of the information
associated to the images selected with the following attributes: no spe-
cic region, no associated infrared image, not belonging to a sequence,
without clouds, not textured, no specic false positive elements, no
specic time, low percentage of re pixels in the image and smoke-re
covering, dominant re color that is orange, no specic smoke color,
with a medium environment brightness, no specic vegetation type, no
specic re distance and no specic direction of re propagation.
The browsing interface allows to download all the selected images or
to select images by considering their information. By clicking on the eye

it exists.
The user downloads a compressed repository that gathers folders and
a csv le. A folder contains at least one visible image and its corre-
sponding ground truth. It can also contain the associated infrared image
if it exits. It has all the images (visible, ground truth and infrared) of the
same sequence. The csv le gives all the descriptor values of each image
identied by a specic number.
In order that this database evolves over time, the website proposes an
interface for the upload of new images or sequences and the recording of
the associated data (Fig. 5). These resources are not directly integrated
with the database and follow a procedure of validation and image pro-
cessing before their publication on the website. Thus, the database can
grow in the future and contain more wildland re images through users
contribution.

3. Fire picture analysis

This section presents examples of processing and analysis that can be
carried out using the dataset.

3.1. Construction of a pixel learning set

Some pixel detection methods like [18,19,21] needs labeled re
pixels for training. Following is the description of the method we have
used in building the pixels learning set. Fifty images of the dataset were
chosen randomly among the ve hundred images. The re pixels of these
fty images were sorted in six categories depending to the color of the
pixels (red, orange, white-yellow) and the presence of smoke. The non
re pixels were classied using three levels of intensity (low, medium

and high). 500 000 non re pixels and 500 000 re pixels were chosen as
follows. For each category, each pixel was represented with a feature
vector constructed from color features extracted using different color
spaces. An average feature vector was computed for each category and
the pixels were sorted based on the distance between their feature vectors
and the average feature vector. The pixels were then sampled uniformly
to obtain the desired number for each category. According to the ob-
servations of Table 3, the pixel distribution was built as follows: 50% of
orange pixels, 33% of red pixels and 17% of white-yellow pixels for re
pixels, and 20% of low intensity pixels, 40% of medium intensity pixels
and 40% of high intensity pixels for non-re pixels. To make it conve-
nient for the processing step, the learning pixels can be organized in
order to create an image of size 1000  1000 whose upper half corre-
sponds to the §re§ pixels and the lower half corresponds to the §non-
re§ pixels. This image presented in Fig. 6 shows the different categories:
region N 1 corresponds to the pixels §red with smoke§, region N 2
contains the pixels §red without smoke §, region N3 includes the §orange
with smoke§ pixels, region N 4 corresponds to the §smokeless orange§
pixels, region N 5 represent §yellow-white pixels§ with smoke and region
N 6 corresponds to §smoke-free yellow-white§ pixels. We can notice that
the §non-re§ pixels of §low§ and §medium luminosity§ are composed of
many pixels with green color (which can be assumed to originate from
the vegetation in the images). The §non-re§ pixels with §high bright-
ness§ represent the color of the sky and the smoke.

characteristics. The performance of
the methods are obtained by
considering standard metrics that compare the re areas obtained by
pixel detection to the ones obtained manually (the ground truth). In this
paper, the F-score [41] is used. As each tested image has associated de-
scriptors, the scores of pixel detection methods can be obtained accord-
ing to the images characteristics as it is shown in Table 4 for three
different state-of-the-art techniques. From these experimental tests, we
can see that for the red colored res, the technique proposed in Ref. [19]
is the best performing overall. For the orange colored res the best
performing techniques are [19] and [29]. For yellow res [29], is the best
performing. The global results on all this colored res (with and without
smoke) show that the best performing technique overall is [19] with an F-
score of 0.91 followed by Ref. [29] with an F-score of 0.88.
This data are useful to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the
algorithms and to benchmark them. If we need to benchmark re pixel
detection is a specic context images (for example re pixels with red
dominant color and medium smoke), it is possible to get the corre-
sponding set of images using the web interface of the database.

4. Conclusion

The Corsican Fire Database aims to provide a common dataset of
multi-modal wildre images and videos. This dataset can be used for
research and training. It also provides categories of re and background
properties. The proposed wildland re images database was designed to
be an evolving database over time. It contains visible spectrum and near
infrared (NIR) images in its current form. Still it was designed to
accommodate other spectrums in the future. The visible spectrum color
images are by far the most used in current research in the area of forest
res and the proposed database provides a large number of images
captured in this spectrum. Additionally, this database contains video
sequences captured simultaneously in color and NIR spectrums. These
image sequences can serve in the study of multispectral fusion algo-
rithms, the analysis of the performance of re segmentation in these
spectrums, the use of motion for re segmentation, etc. The user-friendly
web interface permits the selection of a subset of images based on

193

different criteria. The users can also contribute to the database by
uploading their own images, image sequences (visible, infrared, etc.),
corresponding ground-truth, and the image parameters. The newly added
images are processed using algorithms developed by the authors for
further categorization within the database. All these aspects make the
proposed database an interesting tool for researchers and professionals in
the eld of wildland re study.
