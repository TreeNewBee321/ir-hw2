 The impact of brine water discharge is clear in the upstream reach of the study area.
 When RO units have 85% recovery percent, the max TDS increase is 5.9 % that exceeds the allowed salinity limit.
 When RO units have 50% recovery percent of, the max TDS increase is 2.7% that is less than the allowed salinity limit.
 The TDS increase values vary over the range (8.8-226.3 mg/l) which are b 4ppt (the regulation criteria limit).

abstract

The citizens of Basrah city are suffering from the problem of high salinity water supply. This problem is proposed
to be solved by installing RO units in 16 water treatment plants of Basrah city. RO units produce high-salinity
brine water. The aim of this study is to predict the environmental impact of RO units installation measured in
terms of TDS increase of Shatt Al-Arab River water. The TDS increase was predicted using HEC-RAS software.
The software was applied to simulate twelve cases of TDS distribution in water of Shatt Al-Arab River. During
each of the twelve simulation cases, the proposed RO units were assumed to have recovery percent (RP) of
50% and 85%. The simulation results indicated that when the proposed RO units have RP of 85%, the max percent-
age of TDS increase is 5.9%. While, when the proposed RO units have RP of 50%, the max percentage of TDS is 2.7%.
The comparison of these results with the regulation criteria of brine water discharge shows that; when the
installed RO units have RP of 85%, the percentages of TDS increase will exceed the salinity limit of most regulation
criteria (5%).

1. Introduction

In south of Iraq, Basrah city is depending on Shatt Al Arab River as a
main source of water supply. Until the year 2006, this river received
fresh water from three main sources; Tigris, Euphrates and Al Karun
Rivers. However, now it is receiving fresh water from Tigris River only.
The downstream end of Shatt Al Arab River is affecting by tide phenom-
enon from the north west of the Arabian Gulf. The decrease of fresh
water ow causes the increase of salt intrusion into Shatt Al Arab
River during tide period, which led to increase the salinity level of its
water. In addition, Basrah city is supplying with potable water of low sa-
linity by Sweet Water Canal (SWC). The SWC has suffered numerous
failures since it was commissioned and requires continuous mainte-
nance and monitoring. Several long sections of the canal embankment
are structurally unstable, resulting in steadily worsening performance
and an increasing rate of failure [1].
All the above circumstances led to supply Basrah city citizens with
high salinity water. Many workshops have held in Basrah city to put so-
lutions to the problem of high salinity water supply. One of these work-
shops was held on 15每16/Feb./2014, which is titled ※Basrah Water
Crises and Shatt Al Arab Salinity Increase: Measures to Control§. During
the workshop, a paper was submitted titled ※Practical Solutions for
Water Supply Problem of Basrah City§. The paper suggested the installa-
tion of reverse osmosis (RO) units in main water treatment plants of
Basrah City to desalinate their product water and subsequently enhance
the quality of water supply. After the submission of this paper, a ques-
tion was asked about the environmental impact of RO units installation
on water salinity of Shatt Al Arab River. This question is behind the per-
formance of this study and its results will give the answer.
Desalination process cannot be accomplished without environmen-
tal and ecological inferences [2]. There are many environmental impacts
depending on type of the applied desalination technology, such as
energy consumption, land use, produced the emission of regular fuel
combustion products, and discharge brine during regular operation.
The most important environmental impact produced by desalination
plants is the discharge of brine water [3,4,5]. The characteristics of reject
brine water depend on feed water quality, type and recovery percent of
desalination process and the chemical additives used [6]. Brine water
might adversely affect water and sediment quality, reduce biodiversity,
impairs marine biota or the vital functions of coastal ecosystems [7].
An increased awareness of the environmental impact of discharging
the brine water of desalination plants into the surface waters has
prompted environmental studies in existing plants as well as increased
attention to this issue in both the design and siting of new plants and
plants now in the planning stage [8]. Generally, the rst paper to note
that the brine and chemical discharges from desalination plants may
impair the marine environment probably appeared in 1979 (cited in
[9]). However, it took until the 1990s before the scientic interest in
the marine environmental concerns of desalination plants became
more pronounced, as reected in the large published number of studies.
Examples of these studies include those conducted by; Hpner and
Windelberg [10], Morton et al. [11], Oldeld and Todd [12], Hpner
and Lattemann [13], El-Samanoudi et al. [14], El-Gamal and Abdrabbo
[5], Elabbar and Elmabrouk [8], Medeazza [15], Tularam and Ilahee
[16], Lattemann and Hpner [7,17], M邦nk [18], Abo Qdais [19],
Fern芍ndez-Torquemada et al. [20], Al-Dousari [21], Dupavillon and
Gillanders [2], Ahmed and Anwar [22], Dawoud and Al Mulla [23],
Darwish et al. [24], Naser [25], Fern芍ndez-Torquemada et al. [26] and
Hu [6]. The review of these studies shows that; most of them either ex-
amined and compared the environmental impacts of MSF and RO desa-
lination processes or conducted by collecting eld data from existing
desalination plants.
With regard to the use of modeling techniques (which is the tool
used in this study) in studying the environmental impact of desalination
plants, the review of previous studies shows that there are three com-
mercial numerical softwares (CORMIX, VISUAL PLUMES, and VISJET)
for modeling brine jet discharge. Palomar et al. [27] analyzed and vali-
dated these softwares and indicated that they are limited to near eld
region modeling and CORMIX is a steady-state model. In addition,
Purnama et al. [28] developed a one-dimensional tidally averaged
mathematical model to assess the impact of seawater desalination
plants on water salinity of the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea. They
modeled each of the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea as a semi-enclosed
sea with simple depth topography, parabolic cross sections, and its val-
ley bottom is uniformly descending. Also, Al-Barwani and Purnama [29]
developed a model to simulate the long-time (or far eld) brine plumes
steadily discharged into the seawaters using a two-dimensional advec-
tion-diffusion equation. The model considered the effect of a tidally os-
cillating ow on the long-time brine plume assuming a highly
simplied vertical beach prole, and vertically well-mixed (over the
water depth) brine plume.

3. Overview on Basrah City water supply system

Basrah governorate is supplied with water by 37 main water treat-
ment plants (WTPs), out of which 20 WTPs are located in Basrah city
and its surrounding area, to which the raw water is fed from Shatt Al
Arab River and SWC. The rest is located outside of Basrah city. Table 2
shows the source of water and the design capacity of Basrah city
WTPs and Fig. 1 shows their locations.
All of the WTPs of Basrah city apply conventional water treatment
processes which include; pretreatment, chemical coagulation, rapid
mixing, occulation, sedimentation, ltration and disinfection. Thus,
these WTPs are not provided with facilities for reducing the TDS of
water. To highlight the problem of high TDS water produced by WTPs
in Basrah city, the readings of TDS in treated water were analyzed for
the number of readings that satisfy the Iraqi standards for drinking
water (max. TDS of 1000 mg/l). These readings were monthly taken
during the years (2011每2014) by the staff of Central Laboratory of
Water Analysis/ Basrah Water Administration. The results of analysis
shows that; 735 out of 4477 readings satisfy the Iraqi standards and
the max TDS of water supply in Basrah city is 9400 mg/l. These results
indicate the urgent need for installing desalination units in WTPs of
Basrah city.
Table 2 shows that WTPs No. 17, 18, 19 and 20 (indicated with yel-
low color in Fig. 1) are receiving water from SWC only. When the avail-
able raw water from the SWC is reduced, the water is conveyed to these
WTPs as a priority and the other plants use the water of Shatt Al Arab
River. Therefore, the water of these treatment plants has low TDS and
there is no need for installing RO units in them. Thus, these WTPs
shall not be considered in this study, i.e., the RO units are proposed to
be installed in WTPs No. 1 through 16.

4. Water desalination using reverse osmosis

RO process is used to produce freshwater by removing dissolved
salts from seawater and brackish water, helping to overcome the prob-
lem of freshwater shortage. RO plant consists of pre-treatment, high-
pressure pump units and membranes, Fig. 2. The membranes are set
in series within a pressure vessel. A pretreatment must be provide for
feed water in order to remove inorganic solids and suspended solid,
and for save the membranes from damage and fouling. The process
starts by pumping the feed water (brackish water or seawater) under
the forces of a pressure head that exceeds the osmotic pressure of the
solution through the pressure vessel. As shown in Fig. 2, the fresh
water permeates through the membranes, while, the brine water
(high concentrated solution) is left behind [17]. The main design pa-
rameters of RO plants are; recovery percent, feed and osmotic pressures.

Table 1
Regulations for selected desalination brine discharges [30].

2. Regulatory criteria for brine water discharge

Brine water discharge alternatives include [5]; surface water dis-
charge, disposal to sewage treatment plants, deep well disposal, land
applications, evaporation ponds and brine concentrators. Surface
water discharge is the most used brine disposal method. Since the
most direct waste product of desalination plants is the concentrated
salt brine discharge, all the regulatory criteria of surface water discharge
are concerning the impact of increasing the salinity of the receiving
stream. Jenkins et al. [30] reviewed the regulations or guidelines for
brine discharges around the world as listed in Table 1.
Table 1 shows the variation in the putting regulations, however,
nearly all have two common elements; a salinity limit and a boundary
of mixing zone. The salinity limit is dened as an increment of no
more than 1 to 4 ppt or 5% percent relative to ambient.

In order to apply HEC-RAS software to simulate TDS distribution in
water of Shatt Al Arab River, it is necessary to run the water quality
model. This model requires the input of unsteady ow eld of the
study area. Thus, the unsteady ow model was run, at rst, to simulate
the unsteady ow of this river. Then, the results of this model were used
as inputs to run the water quality model. This section describes the ap-
plications of these two models to simulate the unsteady ow and TDS
distribution in Shatt Al Arab River.

The recovery percent (RP) of the RO system is calculated as;

5. Methodology

In this study, HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Centers-River Anal-
ysis System) software was used to study the impact of discharging brine
water from the proposed RO units on salinity distribution (measured in
terms of TDS) in water of Shatt Al Arab River. HEC-RAS is an open access
software includes four one-dimensional river analysis models for

The data required to model the unsteady ow of Shatt Al Arab River
applying HEC-RAC software are those necessary for specifying the ge-
ometry of the study area and boundary and initial conditions.

5.1.1. Geometry of the study area
The following steps specied the geometry of the study area:

1. Draw of a schematic diagram of Shatt Al River reach. The considered
reach has a length of about 147 km starts from Al-Hartha city and
ends at Al-Fao city as highlighted by red color in Fig. 3.
2. Dene the bathometry of the study area using data of 32 cross sec-
tions along the river reach. These sections are ordered in the reach
from highest river station upstream (section No. 32, Al Hartha city)
to lowest river station downstream (section No. 1, Al Fao city), Fig.
3. The data of each cross section includes; cross section coordinates,
downstream reach length, Manning's roughness coefcient (n)
values (constant n value of 0.03 was used for all the cross sections)
and main channel bank stations. However, after running the ow
model, a warning appears if the specied cross sections in geometric
data are not sufcient (the distance between the specied sections is
too large). The warning message is combined with a request for
adding new cross sections and can be ended by specifying more
cross sections by interpolation. After adding the adequate cross sec-
tions, the nal number of cross sections becomes 1465 (including
the basic 32 sections) and the distance between two successive sec-
tions varies over the range from 79.0每178.5 m.

5.1.2. Boundary conditions
The unsteady ow of the study area was simulated for two statuses;
(1) the absence of brine water discharges (the current status of Shatt Al
Arab River) and (2) the present of brine water discharges (the proposed
status after the installation of RO units). In both statuses, all the lateral
branches of Shatt Al Arab River have been neglected. For simulating
the current status of Shatt Al Arab River ow, the applied boundary con-
ditions include ow hydrograph at the upstream boundary of the study
area (section No. 32) and stage hydrograph at the downstream bound-
ary (section No. 1). The ow hydrograph was developed assuming
steady owrate at the upstream boundary of the study area. This
owrate equals to the owrate of Tigris River. Basrah Water Resources
Administration measures the owrate of Tigris River periodically at
the border of Basrah city. The records of Tigris River owrate were ob-
tained for the years 2009 through 2014 and they were found to be var-
ied over the range (9每97.4) m3/s. Thus, the ow in Shatt Al Arab River
was simulated applying the minimum and maximum discharge values
of Tigris River; 9.0 and 97.4 m3/s. The stage hydrograph was developed
using unsteady tide levels at the downstream boundary of the study
area. The tide data (levels of high and low tides) have been obtained
from the tide tables published by the General Company for Ports of
Iraq in Basrah for the year 2014. Generally, four cases were considered

for simulating the unsteady ow of Shatt Al Arab River. The applied
boundary conditions for these four cases are shown in Table 3.
For simulating the proposed status of unsteady ow in Shatt Al Arab
River after the installation of RO units, additional boundary conditions
were specied at the locations of point sources of brine water discharge
(the considered WTPs). The additional boundary conditions include
specication of lateral inow hydrograph at brine discharge points.
The lateral inow of each point is the steady owrate of produced
brine water (assuming that the WTPs work continuously at constant
rates). As was shown in Eq. (2), the owrate of brine water is dependent
on feed water owrate and recovery percent (RP). It was found, from
the literature review, that the RP of brackish water RO desalination
plants might reach a value of 90%. In this study, the environmental im-
pact of brine water discharges has been simulated applying RP values of
50% and 85%. The distances of the 16 brine water point sources mea-
sured from section No. 1 and the applied lateral inow values for 50%
and 85% recovery percentages are shown in Table 4. The lateral inow
values were calculated using Eq. (2) with adopting RO feed owrates
equal to the design capacities of the considered WTPs as given in
Table 2.

5.1.3. Initial conditions
Initial conditions must be established at the start of unsteady ow
simulation. They can be specied at any cross section of the river
reach, but at least, they must be input at the upper end of the reach. In
this study, the initial condition was specied at the upstream section
of the study area (section No. 32) to be 9 m3/s for Cases-1 and 3 and
97.4 m3/s for Cases-2 and 4.

The water quality model of HEC-RAS software is capable of simulat-
ing water quality of rivers considering the one-dimensional distribution
of different conservative and non-conservative constituents. It uses ex-
plicit numerical scheme to solve the one-dimensional advection-disper-
sion equation [32]. As in unsteady ow simulation, the water quality
model has been applied to simulate TDS distribution in water of Shatt
Al Arab River considering two statuses; (1) the absence of brine water
discharges and (2) the present of brine water discharges. In both status-
es, the run of water quality model requires the specication of ow ve-
locity eld, dispersion coefcient and boundary and initial conditions.
The ow velocity eld is specied using the results of ow model appli-
cation on the study area and the adopted value of dispersion coefcient
is 100 m2/s.

5.2.1. Boundary conditions
A time series boundary condition must be specied for the consid-
ered constitute at all locations where ow enter the system including

However, the boundary conditions at the internal cross sections are
applied to simulate the status of brine water discharges. Generally,
for each ow simulation case, the water quality model has been
run to simulate TDS distribution in water of Shatt Al Arab River con-
sidering three simulation cases; A, B and C. The applied boundary
conditions at the upstream the study area is constant TDS value of
1600, 506, and 1890 mg/l for Cases A, B and C, respectively. These
TDS values were selected from eld measurements conducted at
the corresponding location by Basrah Environment Administration
and Water Resources Administration in Basrah during the years

2009 through 2014. The TDS of brine water has been determined
adopting the following procedure:

a. Run of the ow model to simulate the ow of Shatt Al Arab River
during a period of four days and for the status of the absence of
brine water discharges.
b. Run of water quality model using the results of ow model.
c. Specication of maximum TDS of Shatt Al Arab water at the locations
of brine water discharges.

5.2.2. Initial conditions
The water quality model of HEC-RAS software requires the input of
at least one initial condition value for simulating the distribution of
any constituent. It, then, generates a table of initial conditions at all
water quality computational points by interpolation. In this study, for
the rst run of water quality model, the initial TDS values were specied
at the upstream and downstream boundaries (section Nos. 32 and 1) as
shown in Table 4. While, for the subsequent run, the obtained results of
TDS values at the last time step of the rst run were applied as initial
conditions. In Table 5, the rst notation in case number denotes the

ow simulation case, i.e., Case No. 1A denotes the TDS simulation case
when ow condition of Case-1 and TDS boundary conditions of Case-A
are applied.

6. Results and discussion

Two models of HEC-RAS software; ow and water quality models
were applied on Shatt Al Arab River. The results of the ow model are
used as input data to run the water quality model. The water quality
model was applied on the study area to assess the environmental im-
pact of installing RO units in 16 main WTPs of Basrah city. The environ-
mental impact was assessed by studying the impact of discharging high
TDS brine water on TDS of Shatt Al Arab water. This section presents the
results of ow and water quality models validation. It, also, presents the
results of environmental impact assessment of RO units installation.

6.1. Flow model validation

To validate the results of ow model, the computed values of ow
velocity were compared with those measured at a section located at
the mouth of Umm Al Rasas Island in Shatt Al Arab River. This island is
located at 35 km south of Basrah city. The ow velocity was measured
by Al-Whaely et al. [33]. The comparison results are shown in Table 6.
From this table, it can be noticed that the range of computed ow veloc-
ities during the four simulation cases is (0.23每0.34) m/s which is in good
agreement with that of the measured values (0.25每0.32) m/s.
In addition, the computed owrates of the four simulation cases
were compared with measured ones. The owrates were measured by
Al-Maliky [34] at three stations (Nos. 1, 2 and 3) along Shatt Al Arab
River. The distances of station Nos. 1, 2 and 3 measured from Al Fao
city, are 10, 60 and 120 km, respectively. Table 7 shows the comparison
results. From this table, it can be noticed that the computed owrates of
the four cases at the three stations are within the ranges of the mea-
sured ones.

6.2. Water quality model validation

The water quality model was validated by comparing its results with
eld measurements of TDS. The model results include the temporal var-
ied TDS distributions which were obtained by running the 12 simulation
cases; 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B and 4C without the exis-
tence of brine water discharges. The eld values of TDS were measured
by Al-Maliky [35] and the crew of Water Resources Administration. Al-
Maliky measured the TDS at station Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the crew of
Water Resources Administration measured the TDS at station Nos. 5,
6, 7 and 8. The locations of these stations along Shatt Al Arab River are
shown in Fig. 6.

For each simulation case, the min and max values of temporal varied
TDS where obtained at the location of each measurement station. Then,
the range of calculated TDS values at each station was obtained from the
min and max values of all the simulation cases. This TDS range was com-
pared with the range of measured TDS at the corresponding station. The
comparison results are shown in Table 8. This table shows that the cal-
culated TDS values at station Nos. 2, 5, 6 and 7 are within the measured
ranges. While, the min calculated TDS values at station Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 8
are lower than the corresponding measured ones. Also, the max calcu-
lated TDS value at station No. 4 is greater than the corresponding mea-
sured one. The differences between the measured and calculated TDS
values are attributed to; (1) the applied boundary conditions which dif-
fer from those actually occurred during the performance of eld mea-
surements and (2) the simplications adopted during the applications
of both ow and water quality models, such as neglecting the lateral
branches of Shatt Al Arab River. However, for the aim of studying the en-
vironmental impact of installing RO units in main WTPs of Basrah city,
the water quality model results are thought to be accepted.

6.3. TDS distribution in Shatt Al Arab water

For all the simulation cases (12 cases), the results of TDS distribution
in water of Shatt Al Arab River without the existence of BW, with the ex-
istence of BW at 50% RP and with the existence of BW at 85% RP during
low and high tide times were plotted to study the impact of BW dis-
charges. Herein, examples of these plots are shown for Case-2A at
high tide (HT), Case-3C at low tide (LT) and Case-4A at LT in Figs. 7, 8
and 9, respectively. In each of these gures, the TDS longitudinal distri-
bution in the study area is shown for the whole reach and for a reach ex-
tends from km 60 to km 140 of the study area. From these gures and
when the TDS distribution is plotted for the whole reach of Shatt Al
Arab River, the TDS distributions without the existence of BW dis-
charges cannot be distinguished from those with the existence of BW
discharges. While, when the TDS distribution is plotted for a reach of
the study area extending from km 60 to km 140, the effect of BW dis-
charge on TDS distribution appears. Where it can be noticed that the
TDS of Shatt Al Arab water increases when BW is discharged and if the
installed RO units are of 85% RP, the increase of TDS values will be great-
er than that obtained when the installed RO units are of 50% RP. The ef-
fect of BW discharge appears in the specied reach of the study area
because the locations of all the considered WTPs are distributed be-
tween km 97.76 and km 138.54.

For illustrating the effect of BW discharges on TDS of Shatt Al Arab
River water, the results of TDS temporal variation during simulation
Cases-4A, 4B and 4C have been plotted at six sections (section Nos. 31,
27, 24, 22, 12 and 4) along this river. These sections are located at dis-
tances of 118,199, 110,002, 95,865, 86,174, 73,210 and 61,539 m, re-
spectively, from the downstream boundary of the study area (Section
No. 1). The TDS temporal variation results of Cases-4A, 4B and 4C are
shown in Figs. 10 through 12, respectively. In these gures, the blue,
red and green lines represent the absence of BW discharge, the exis-
tence of BW discharge at RP of 50% and the existence of BW discharge
at RP of 85%, respectively.
Figs. 10 through 12 show that the BW discharges increase the TDS of
Shatt Al Arab water. This impact differs along the study area due to the
interactions of; tide effect, location of WTPs and owrate and TDS of
brine water. For example, if Fig. 10 is considered, it can be noticed that
the TDS values at any section varies with time due to tide effect; in-
crease during ood period and decrease during ebb period. This varia-
tion reduces towards the upstream end of the study area due to the
reduction of tidal range. At specic hour, the TDS increases in any sec-
tion with the existence of BW discharge and the increase at 85% RP is
greater than that at 50% RP.
From the results of Figs. 10 through 12 and for each simulation case,
the values of max and min TDS with and without the existence of BW
discharges were obtained. From these values it was found that during
Case-4A, the max TDS value at Section No. 31 increases from 1619.7 to
1646.3 (with BW at 50% RP) and to 1666.5 (with BW at 85% RP). Thus,
the percentages of TDS increase are 1.64 and 2.89% for BW at 50 and
85%, respectively. While, the percentages of TDS increase at Section
No. 4 are 0.50 and 2.19% for BW at 50 and 85%, respectively. I.e., the
TDS increase near the upstream end of the study area is greater than
that near the downstream end of the study area. That can be referred
to; (1) the owrate of Shatt Al Arab River increases towards the down-
stream end, thus, the impact of BW is inhibited by the high dilution of
owing water and (2) all the considered WTPs are distributed between
km 97.76 and km 138.54, i.e., near the upstream end of the study area.

6.4. Environmental impact assessment of brine water discharge

The environmental impact of RO units installation in 16 main WTPs
of Basrah city is assessed in terms of max percentage of TDS increase due
to brine water discharges from the proposed units. This percent was

calculated at LT and HT times of each simulation case considering 50
and 85% RP. The obtained max percentages of TDS increase along with
their occurrence section numbers are listed in Table 9. In this table,
the notation 1A50, as an example, denotes Case-1A with considering
the installation of RO units have RP of 50% in all the considered water
treatment plants. Table 9 shows the followings:

1. During all the simulation cases, the max percentages of TDS increase
occur at sections number distributed between 23.6928* and
31.3088. This can be attributed to the locations of brine water dis-
charge sources (WTPs location) which are distributed between sec-
tion No. 23.5106 and section No. 31.7028, see Table 4. Thus, their
combined impact on increasing the TDS of Shatt Al Arab water will
be signicant in this reach.
2. The highest max percentage of TDS increase in Shatt Al Arab River
water is 5.9%. This percent occurs at section No. 26.6047* during sim-
ulation Case-3C85 at HT time. That is because Case-3C85 is character-
ized by;
a. min owrate of Tigris River at the upstream boundary of the study
area which is 9.0 m3/s,
b. max tidal range at the downstream boundary of the study area,
c. high TDS values at both upstream and downstream boundaries of
the study area, and
d. high TDS values of the discharged brine waters.
3. When the installed RO units have RP of 50%, the results of all simula-
tion cases give max percentages of TDS increase vary over the range
(1.6每2.7%). With referring to Table 1, which listed the regulations
concerning the allowed limits of brine water TDS, it can be shown
that the max allowed salinity increase percentage is 5%. Thus, the
max percentages of TDS increase in water of Shatt Al Arab River if
RO units are of 50% shall be below the allowed limit.
4. When the installed RO units have RP of 85%, the max percentages of
TDS increase during simulation Case Nos. 1A, 1B, 1C, 3A, 3B and 3C
(highlighted in yellow color) vary over the range (5.1 to 5.9%). That
means, the TDS increase due to the installation of RO units shall ex-
ceed the allowed limit (5%). During all these cases, the upstream
water inow from Tigris River to the study area is 9.0 m3/s. This
owrate value is the min recorded owrate value during ve years
period. When the installed RO units have RP of 85%, the max percent-
ages of TDS increase during simulation Case Nos. 2A, 2B, 2C, 4A, 4B
and 4C vary over the range (3.9每4.4%). Thus, the max percentages
are less than the allowed limit (5%). During these cases, the upstream
water inow from Tigris River to the study area is 97.4 m3/s. This
owrate value is the max recorded owrate value during ve years
period.
5. The results of all the simulation cases indicate that the max TDS in-
crease vary over the range (8.8每226.3 mg/l). With referring to
Table 1, some regulations specied the allowed limit of TDS increase
to be no more than 1 to 4 ppt. Thus, the TDS increase due to the in-
stallation of RO units in the considered WTPs of Basrah city shall be
less than the allowed limit.

7. Conclusions

The environmental impact of installing RO units in 16 main WTPs of
Basrah city has been assessed by simulating the TDS distribution in

Shatt Al Arab River considering 12 different cases. During each case, two
RP of RO units were applied; 50 and 85%. From the assessment results,
the following conclusions were drawn:

1. The impact of brine water discharge varies along Shatt Al Arab River
and it is obvious in a reach extends from km 60 to km 140 measured
from the downstream end of the study area (Al Fao city).

2. When the installed RO units have RP of 85%, the max percentages of
TDS increase vary over the ranges (5.1 to 5.9%) and (3.9 to 4.4%) dur-
ing the cases of min and max owrates of Tigris River, respectively.
Thus, during the cases of min Tigris River owrate, the TDS increase
percentages exceed the salinity limit of 5%.
3. When the installed RO units have RP of 50%, the max percentages of
TDS increase vary over the range (1.6 to 2.7%) which are lower than
the salinity limit specied by all regulation criteria.
4. During all the simulation cases, the TDS increase values vary over the
range (8.8每226.3 mg/l) and they are lower than the specied limits
by the regulation criteria which is no more than 4 ppt.
