abstract

A general ion-transport equation has been derived eliminating the electrophoresis term from the set of Nernst-
Planck equations for cations and anions, under the local electro-neutrality assumption. Boundary layer solutions
were obtained for the two asymptotic cases of sufciently short and long channels, respectively, when the electric
current is applied uniformly across the channels. A local volume averaging theory for porous media was also in-
troduced to describe the cases of electrodialysis stacks with spacers. The results obtained for both with and with-
out spacers are compared against available experimental data. The predicted limiting current density and stack
voltage based on the asymptotic solutions for sufciently short channels agree well with those of measurements
for both cases with and without spacers, revealing the validity of the present analysis based on the local electro-
neutrality assumption. It has been clearly shown that the spacers work to delay possible depletion of the ions on
the dilute side of the membrane, thus increasing the limiting current density.

1. Introduction

Electrodialysis, which exploits an electrochemical separation pro-
cess, is a quite effective means to treat brackish water, since it is versa-
tile with respect to avoiding possible scaling and fouling. It has been a
common practice to use an electrodialyser for water desalination, so
as to remove dissolved minerals such as salts from seawater, wastewa-
ter or brackish water e.g. [1,2,3,4]. The electrodialysis process has ad-
vantages over conventional distillation techniques and other
membrane based processes such as those using reverse osmosis [5],
since, in this electrodialysis process, small quantity of dissolved species
are removed away from large quantity of feed water rather than remov-
ing the large quantity of water from the small quantity of feed water, as
in reverse osmosis.

The electrodialyser uses ion-exchange membranes e.g. [1] to transfer
ions from dilute to concentrate chambers under the inuence of an ap-
plied electric potential difference. The ion-exchange membrane electro-
dialysis stack, as shown in Fig. 1, consists of two electrodes, namely,
anode and cathode. Between these electrodes, a number of dilute and
concentrate channels are positioned to transfer ions through the ion-ex-
change membranes.
A unit cell in the stack refers to as a pair of adjacent dilute and con-
centrate channels formed by an anion exchange membrane (A. E. M.)
and a cation exchange membrane (C. E. M.). These two kinds of mem-
branes are placed alternately under the applied electric eld. As the
ions transfer through the membranes, the dilute cell loses the ions
while the adjacent concentrate cell collects them. Thus, the bulk ion
concentration in the dilute cell decreases while the that in the concen-
trate cell increases as the feed water, supplied from below, ows up-
ward to the exit.
A substantial number of researchers attacked the Nernst-Planck
equation, to investigate the ion transport from the dilute channel to

concentrate channel through membranes e.g. [6,7,8]. Most of these in-
vestigations focus on one-directional ion transport across the channels
and membranes. However, it is the role of thin concentration boundary

layer that determines the electrodialyser performance. Therefore, we
must take full account of the boundary layer nature hidden in the
Nernst-Planck equation.
In the dilute channel boundary layer, the ionic concentration de-
ceases towards the C. E. M., whereas, in the concentrate channel, the
ionic concentration, which is higher than that of the dilute channel, de-
creases away from the C. E. M., which is called ¡°concentration polariza-
tion¡±. A thinner boundary layer allows a steeper concentration at the
membrane surfaces, thus, allowing a greater electric current to pass
through the membrane. The electric current density that causes zero
concentration on the ion exchange membranes as the result of excessive
concentration polarization is termed as ¡°limiting current density¡± e.g. [9,
10]. This limiting current density is of great importance in practical ap-
plications, since, just under this limiting current density, the maximum
ionic separation rate can be achieved in the electrodialyser without vio-
lating the electro-neutrality. When the limiting current density is
exceeded, the electrical resistance in the dilute solution increases dras-
tically due to the depletion of the ions within the boundary layer. The
current above the limiting value is called ¡°overlimiting current¡±. Thus,
any electrodialysis operations should be conducted below this limiting
current to avoid water dissociation.
There are a number of theoretical and experimental investigations
associated with ion concentration boundary layers, including those of
Lee at al. [11] and Tanaka [12,13,14]. Tobias et al. [15] provides a review
on diffusion and convection of ions in electrolysis and theoretical
methods for predicting its diffusion layer. The ion lm thickness was es-
timated for various cases appealing to mass, heat and momentum anal-
ogy and dimensional analysis. However,
the boundary layer
development in a multichannel system in electrodialysis has not been
treated, perhaps, due to its complexity. Sonin and Probstein [16] pro-
posed a hydrodynamic theory of desalination by electrodialysis. A clas-
sical integral method was used to obtain approximate solutions. An
empirical matching formula for the limiting current density was intro-
duced to cover a wide range of operating conditions.
Nevertheless, analytical boundary layer treatments based on the
similarity transformations have not been reported in the literature. In
this study, a general ion transport equation will be derived from the
Nernst-Planck equation under the assumption of local electro-neutrali-
ty. The resulting ion transport equation is considered along with the
prevailed velocity eld. The classical boundary layer treatments
established in viscous ows [17] are revisited to obtain possible similar-
ity solutions for the two asymptotic cases of sufciently short and long
channels in the electrodialyser, when the electric current is applied uni-
formly across the channels.
A volume averaging theory will also be introduced for the rst time
to derive a volume averaged version of the Nernst-Planck equation,
which is used to attack the case of electrodialysers with spacers [18].
It will be shown that the asymptotic solutions for sufciently short
channels agree well with that of measurement for both cases with and
without spacers. This substantiates the validity of the present analysis
based on the local electro-neutrality assumption.

3. Asymptotic solutions for an electrodialyser without spacers

As shown in Fig. 2, a unit cell consisting a pair of dilute and concen-
trate channels is considered for the analysis. This unit cell can represent
any one of cells in the electrodialysis stack, in which the membrane
thickness is negligible as compared with the channel widthW. The
Reynolds number within the channel, namely, Re  W uc =¦Í , is usually
sufciently small, so that the ow eld throughout the channel is
hydro-dynamically fully developed, whereas the ion concentration
eld in the entrance region is still developing due to comparatively
high Schmidt number Sc= ¦Í/De. In what follows, we shall focus on the
transport of the sodium chloride ions Na+ and Cl(i.e. z1 = 1and z2 =
 1) within an electrodialyser without spacers.

3.1. Asymptotic solutions for long channels.

Since the transverse ow across the membrane due to the osmotic
pressure is negligible, the following parabolic velocity prole based on

slender channel, and the ¡°short channel¡± region at xbbudW 2 =De corre-
sponding to the concentration boundary layer developing region.

4. Asymptotic solutions for an electrodialyser with spacers

Most electrodialysers in industrial applications have spacers be-
tween the cation and anion exchange membranes. The spacers are
used to hold the adjacent membranes apart to provide a passage for
the solutions. Another important role of the spacers is to mix the solu-
tions in the channels, and thus, to delay depletion of ions, increasing

the value of the limiting current density. Flows though channels with
spacers may be treated as ows in porous media, in which the volume
averaging theory, e.g. [19,20,21,22], may be exploited. In the volume av-
eraging theory, each quantity  is decomposed into its local volume av-
erage f and spatial derivation ~ from it such that
  h i f  ~

31

With this decomposition, the general ion transport equation may be
integrated over a local control volume V, to yield the following volume
averaged equation written in terms of the volume averaged quantities:

where ¦Å is the porosity (i.e. the volume fraction which the solution oc-
cupies), which is usually close to unity. Mathematical details in the
volume averaging procedure may be found in a textbook such as [20].
In the equation, the interfacial terms (i.e. the last two RHS terms)
vanish due to no-slip and no-ion ux conditions on the interface Aint,
namely, u j  0
and ( c/ xj)nj = 0. Furthermore, the tortuosity in ion

In a passage lled with a porous medium, the Darcy ow (i.e. macro-

given by hu j i  ud ; 0; 0. Note that ud is the apparent bulk mean velocity
in a porous channel, namely, the bulk mean velocity of the feed ow at
the inlet section without a porous medium. Thus, for the case of the di-

temperature of a thin disk of uid in the hydro-dynamically fully devel-
oped ow is suddenly raised to a certain temperature and the tempera-
ture distribution thereafter within the uid in a tube is sought to nd
out the thermal dispersion coefcient. They analytically found that the
thermal dispersion coefcient is in proportional to the product of the
mean velocity and some reference length scale (which is consistent
with both dimensional analysis and experimental evidence [20]) and
subsequently, proposed an analogy between heat and mass transfer
analogy. Their analogy can be exploited for the present case of ion

suggests ¦ÎudW  uref lref where uref and lref are the reference velocity

spacers. Thus, ¦Î roughly gives the ratio uref lref =udW , which is natural-
ly expected to be very small, since both ud and Ware external macro
scales.

5. Determination of stack voltage

The stack voltage (cell voltage), which refers to as the potential drop
per unit cell consisting of a pair of cells and a pair of membranes, can be
estimated, using Eq. (6) for the case of the sodium chloride (i.e.
z1 = 1and z2 =  1). Thus, the dimensionless voltage drop across the di-
lute cell is given by

6. Results and discussion

Fujimoto [24] carried out a careful experiment using an
electrodialyser with and without spacers. The specications in his ex-
periment are listed in Table 1. He measured the voltage against the ap-
plied electric current and observed a marked increase in the voltage
when the limiting current density was achieved as the result of incipi-
ence of water dissociation.

The measured values of the limiting current density for the case of
electrodialyser without spacers are plotted against the feed velocity ud in
Fig. 3(a), where the asymptotic solution for the case of short channel with-
out spacers, namely, Eq. (30), is also presented. The cases treated in his ex-
periment correspond to udW 2 =De L  260  1300NN1, so that the short
channel solution may well sufce to describe the cases. Tado [25] carried
out numerical calculations solving the set of the governing equations,
namely, the continuity equation, Navier-Stokes equation and Nernst-
Planck equation with appropriate boundary conditions. His results,
which agree well with the present asymptotic solution, are presented in
the same gure. The gure indicates that both present asymptotic solution
and numerical solution overestimate the limiting current density to some
extent. Nevertheless, the agreement between the present analysis and
measurement appears to be fairly good over a wide range of the feed
velocity.
Another set of experimental data on electrodialysers without spacers
were provided by Lee et al. [11], in which udW 2 =De L  7700  23000NN
1. The experimental details of their electrodialyser are listed in Table 2.
In Fig. 3(b), their experimental data obtained for different feed concen-
trations are presented along with the short channel formula for the dia-
lyser without spacers, Eq. (30), so as to see the effect of the feed
concentration cd 0  cc 0 on the limiting current density. The curves
based on the present analysis agree well with the experimental data
cd 0 = 8 to 50 mol/m3, whereas the analysis
for the cases of
underestimates the limiting current density for the case of cd 0 =
100 mol/m3.
The limiting current density is solely determined from the boundary
layer characteristics in the dilute channel. The comparison also reveals
that the limiting current density is sensitive to the feed concentration
1=3 cd 0 for the
but rather insensitive to the feed velocity, since ilim ¡Ø ud
case of dialyser without spacers.
Fujimoto [24] also set up an electrodialyser with channels lled with
ceramic foam with the porosity ¦Å = 0.91 and conducted an experiment
to investigate the effect of mechanical dispersion on the limiting current
density. In Fig. 4, his experimental data on the electrodialyser with
ceramic foam, which correspond to the case of short channel (i.e. udW 2
=¦ÅDe 1  ¦Î udW
L  300  700NN1), are presented with the theoretical
curve based on the short channel solution for the case of dialyser with
porous media, namely, Eq. (44). The empirical coefcient ¦Î for the me-
chanical dispersion has been set to ¦Î = 1.5 ¡Á 10 5.
A good agreement between the present formula and the experiment
can be seen from Fig. 4, which substantiates the validity of the present
analysis based on the volume averaging theory. It is interesting to note
that the limiting current density is almost proportional to the feed velocity,
since Eq. (44) for the case of dialyser with porous media suggests ilim ¡Ø ud
for substantial mechanical dispersion. Thus, for the case of dialyser with
porous media, the depletion of the ions on the membrane is retarded effec-
tively by increasing the feed velocity ud .
Practical electrodialysers with spacers are designed such that the con-
centration boundary layer thickness is kept sufciently thin even at the
exit of the channel. Thus, most data under practical operational conditions
should fall within the short channel regime. The comparison of the present
formulas for the cases of with and without spacers clearly indicates that
the short channel formulas (30) and (44) describe most practical cases
fairly well. Hence, they can be used to estimate the limiting current density
when designing electrodialysers with and without spacers. However, there
will be certain cases in which the brackish water ows at very low velocity
in narrow and long channels such that udW 2 =¦ÅDe Lbb1, and then, the as-
ymptotic solution for long channel may be used to estimate the limiting
current density.
Finally, in Fig. 5, the stack voltage data for the case of electrodia-
lyser without spacers a t ud  uc = 0 .05 m /s and cd 0  cc 0 =
342 mol/m3 , provided by Fujimoto [24] , are presented against the
appl ied current density . In the gure , the theoret ica l curve based

such uctuations. The mechanism of the ion transport above the limit-
ing current density is studied by Nikonenko et al. [27,28] applying the
Nernst-Planck equation to both uid and membrane phases. As pointed
out by Tedesco et al. [29], non-ideal behavior of membranes such as ef-
fect of co-ion transport through the membranes is also important and
should be investigated further.

7. Conclusions

A general ion transport equation valid for ion solutions has been de-
rived from the Nernst-Planck equation by eliminating the electrophore-
sis term. The resulting transport equation turns out to be the
conventional convection-diffusion transport equation with an effective
(harmonic) diffusion coefcient. A classical boundary layer treatment
was introduced to attack the ion transport equation to obtain the as-
ymptotic similarity solutions for the short and long channel regions in
electrodialysers without spacers, when the electric current is applied
uniformly across the channels.
Furthermore, a volume averaging theory was exploited to transform
the ion transport equation to its volume averaged version, so as to de-
scribe the transport phenomena associated with electrodialysers with
spacers. Both short and long channel asymptotic solutions were obtain-
ed for the case of uniformly applied electric current, to reveal the effects
of the mechanical dispersion on the limiting current density. The pre-
dicted values of the limiting current density and stack voltage based
on the short channel solutions were found to agree well with the exper-
imental data obtained using electrodialysers with and without spacers.

on Eq. (48) is also presented for comparison. The stack voltage is the
summation of the potential drops resulting from the dilute channel
¦¤¦Õd(L) and the concentrate channe l ¦¤¦Õc(L) , in add ition to those
resulting from the cation and anion exchange membranes, namely,
¦¤¦Õ ce l l = ¦¤¦Õd + ¦¤¦Õ c + iR ca t ion + iRan ion . The membrane res istances
are prov ided by the manu facture as Rca t ion = 3 .0 ¡Á 10 4¦¸m2 and
Ran ion = 2 .4 ¡Á 10 4¦¸m2 . The pred ict ion based on Eq . (48) agrees
fairly well with the experimental data towards the limiting current
density, which is singular in Eq. (48) . Thereafter, the stack voltage
drastically increases due to the depletion of ions.
Unfortunately, the present theory based on the local electro-neutral-
ity assumption cannot describe the ion transport mechanism beyond
this depletion of ions. If a current density larger than its limiting value
is applied, the drastic increase in the voltage will be followed by strong
uctuations around an average value. Krol et al. [26] pointed out that
hydrodynamic instabilities close to the membrane are responsible for

It is clearly shown that the presence of spacers works to delay possible
depletion of the ions on the dilute side of the membrane, thus increasing
the limiting current density.
