abstract

Detecting complex events in a large video collection crawled from video websites is a challenging task. 
When applying directly good image-based feature representation, e.g., HOG, SIFT, to videos, we have to 
face the problem of how to pool multiple frame feature representations into one feature representa- 
tion. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based frame pooling method. We formulate the pooling 
weight learning as an optimization problem and thus our method can automatically learn the best pool- 
ing weight conguration for each specic event category. Extensive experimental results conducted on 
TRECVID MED 2011 reveal that our method outperforms the commonly used average pooling and max 
pooling strategies on both high-level and low-level features.

1. Introduction 

Complex event detection aims to detect events, such as ¡°mar- 
riage proposal¡±, ¡°renovating a home¡±, in a large video collection 
crawled from video websites, like Youtube. This technique can 
be extensively applied to Internet video retrieval, content-based 
video analysis and machine intelligence elds and thus has re- 
cently attracted much research attention [1¨C5] . Nevertheless, the 
complex event detection encounters lots of challenges, mostly be- 
cause events are usually more complicated and undenable, pos- 
sessing great intra-class variations and variable video durations, as 
compared with traditional concept analysis in constrained video 
clips, e.g., action recognition [6,7] . For example, identical events, 
as shown in Fig. 1 , are entirely distinct in different videos, with 
various scenes, animals, illumination and views. Even in the same 
video, these factors are also changing. The above reasons make 
event detection far from being applicable to practical use with ro- 
bust performance. 
A large number of methods have been proposed to handle 
this challenging task [8¨C11] . Generally speaking, the video rep- 
resentation is one of the most important components. For many 
techniques to extract the video representation, namely feature de- 
scriptors, have to be carefully designed or selected for good detec- 
tion performance. Different from images, video clips can be treated 
as spatial-temporal 3D cuboids. Lots of spatial-temporal oriented 
feature descriptors have been proposed and been proved effective, 
such as HOG3D [12] , MoSIFT [13] , 3DSIFT [14] and the state- 
the-art improved Dense Trajectory (IDT) [15] . Although these 
spatial-temporal descriptors can intrinsically describe videos, the 
2D image descriptors are still very important for describing videos 
in the complex event detection community due to two aspects. 
On one hand, compared with 2D image descriptors, the spatial- 
temporal feature descriptors usually require larger data storage and 
higher computational complexity to be extracted and processed. 
This problem becomes more serious for large scale datasets. On 
the other hand, the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) 
evaluation track [16] of each year, held by NIST, reveals that com- 
bining kinds of feature descriptors, including 2D and 3D features, 
usually outperforms those of using a single feature descriptor [17] . 
Proting from the research development in image representa- 
tions, a number of good features, including low-level ones of such 
HOG [18] , SIFT [19] , and high-level features of such Object-bank 
[20] along with the recently most successful Convolutional Neu- 
ral Network (CNN) feature [21] can be directly applied to describe 
the video. The commonly used strategy is to extract the feature 
representation for each frame or selected key frames of the video 
(we will use frame hereinafter) and then pool all feature represen- 
tations into one representation with average pooling or max pooling 
[22] . While the max pooling just uses the maximum response of 
all frames for each feature dimension, the average pooling uses 
their average value. It is hard to say which one of these two pool- 
ing strategies is better. Sometimes, average pooling is better than 
max pooling and vice versa. The performance heavily depends on 
the practical application or datasets. The actual strategy is man- 
ually choosing the better one through experiments conducted on 
a validation set. Therefore, intuitively, here comes two questions: 
1) can we automatically choose the better one between the two

event. 

previous pooling strategies? 2) is there any pooling method supe- 
rior to these two strategies? 
To answer these two questions mentioned above, we propose a 
novel learning-based frame pooling method. We notice that when 
human beings observe different events, they usually have different 
attention on various frames, i.e., the pooling weight for a partic- 
ular event is inconsistent with the others. This phenomenon in- 
spires us to adaptively learn the optimal pooling way from data. In 
other words, our approach can automatically derive the best pool- 
ing weight conguration for each specic event category. To this 
end, we design an alternative search strategy, which embeds the 
optimization process for frame pooling weight and classier pa- 
rameters into a unifying optimization problem. Experimental re- 
sults conducted on TRECVID MED 2011 reveal that our learning- 
based frame pooling method outperforms the commonly used av- 
erage pooling and max pooling strategies on both high-level and 
low-level image features. 
The rest part of this paper is organized as following. In 
Section 2 , we present our proposed methodology for video descrip- 
tion task. Section 3 shows the experimental results with various 
low-level and high-level features. The conclusion is nally given in 
Section 4 . 

Fig. 2. The overall framework of our method. Given an input video V i , the encoded 
frame level features y ( i, j ) ( t ) are rstly extracted. They are then sorted in descent 
order followed by Lagrange interpolation and are sampled for a feature matrix X i 
including T frames. We employ the alternatively learned optimal pooling weight ¦È
and the classier parameters on X i for the nal classication over X i . 

stage, we pool the sampled features on interpolation functions 
with weights obtained by our learning method which will be de- 
scribed below. Finally, a classier is employed for the event detec- 
tion results.

Our goal is to learn a uniform feature pooling weight setting 
for each specic event. However, the number of features extracted 
from videos are different due to different key frames or different 
video durations when we sample at xed frame rates. To address 
this problem, the interpolation operation is adopted. 
Given a video clip V i 
with T i 
frames, we can get T i 
encoded

feature vectors y (i, j )
 . Note 
that the feature vectors y ( i, j ) 
( t ) could either be the raw frame level 
features like HOG and SIFT, spatial-temporal features like C3D [23] , 
or their encoded counterparts including the Bag-of-Words repre- 
sentation of HOG, SIFT, etc. Hence, m is the dimension of the fea- 
ture in each frame depending on the feature extractor or the size 
of codebook used for encoding. Ideally, we may directly construct 
(u 
)
a Lagrange interpolation function 
 for the jth feature dimen- 
sion, i.e., the jth dimension of the input frame level features, as 
following:

2. The proposed method 

2.1. Overview of our framework 

Our proposed algorithm consists of three main modules: pre- 
processing, feature pooling and classication, as shown in Fig. 2 . 
During the pre-processing stage, we extract the features of all 
frames and then independently sort feature values of all dimen- 
sions of the feature vectors in descent order. Then, the Lagrange 
interpolation and sampling operations are conducted on each video 
with different frames, to get xed number features. In pooling 

 f i, j 

where 
(u 
)
 can t all the responses at each time (frame) u in the 
original video clip. With the interpolated functions for all feature 
dimensions, we may then re-sample a xed number of the feature 
representations. Thus, videos with various durations are eventually 
able to re-normalized with the same number T of feature repre- 
sentations. 
However, we would encounter the ¡°over-tting¡± problem if di- 
rectly conducting interpolating operation on the original encoded 
features. This is due to the fact that the original feature values 
from one dimension may varies greatly even between consecutive 
frames and hence will cause the corresponding interpolation func-

47 

tion to vary dramatically in the feature space. This would produce 
potential noise data. 
For the sake of alleviating this problem, we sort independently 
all features for each dimension before constructing the Lagrange in- 
terpolation function. Specically, for each dimension of m feature 
dimensions, T feature values are sorted in descent order. In this 
way, the interpolation function will tend to gradually decreasing 
in the feature space. Later, we sample along the temporal axis for 
the jth feature dimension with the interpolation function 
(u 
)
denoted as x i, j 
:

2.3. Formulation 

Given n training samples ( X i 
) 
(i 
)
 where the X i 
is the feature matrix obtained by Section 2.2 and y i 
is the sam- 
ple label, our goal is to learn a weight parameter to pool the fea- 
ture matrix X i 
into a single feature vector. Actually, for both av- 
erage and max pooling methods, the pooling operation is done 
independently for each feature dimension. Intuitively, we should 
¦È j ( j 
)
learn an independent weight vector 
 for each di- 
mension. However, this would make the model too complex to 
be learned effectively. Instead, we learn a single weight vector 
for all dimensions. Namely, we pool the features using the same 
¦È . Because our inter- 
weight vector for all feature dimensions as X i 
polation function f i, j 
will perform a decreasing property in feature 
space, we can easily know that the cases of 
(1 
)
 and 
(1 
 0)
 approximately correspond to average and max 
pooling strategies, respectively. Furthermore, the medium and min- 
imum pooling strategies can also be approximately viewed as two 
specic cases, where 
(0 
 0)
 (1 is located in the mid- 
dle position of the vector) and 
(0 
 1)
 respectively. Since 
our goal is to learn an optimal pooling strategy for each event. To 
this end, the problem of pooling parameter 
¦È learning is formu- 
lated as the following optimization problem:

Directly solving this optimization problem would be very complex 
because the hinge loss and the constraints on 
¦È make it a non- 
convex function. In this degree, a transformation of the above op- 
timization problem needs to be conducted by relaxing the convex 
property. For a particular video sample V i 
in the training set, we 
introduce a 
for it, measuring the corresponding upper bound of 
the classication error of V i 
in the SVM classier. According to the

3. Experiments 

We evaluate our proposed model on the public large scale 
TRECVID MED 2011 dataset [16] with both low-level features: HOG 
[18] , SIFT [19] , high-level features: Object Bank-based feature [20] , 
CNN-based feature [21] and a 3D feature C3D [23] , and fused fea- 
tures. We adopt the most popular pooling methods of the max and 
average pooling as the baseline methods for comparisons. Mean- 
while, we compare our method with several event detection meth- 
ods evaluated by using the same metric. Finally, we visualize the 
learned pooling parameters to give more insights. 

3.1. Dataset and evaluation metric 

The TRECVID MED 2011 development set [16] is used to eval- 
uate our method. It contains more than 13,0 0 0 video clips over 
18 different kinds of events and background classes, which pro- 
vides us with real life web video instances consisting of complex 
events under different scenes lasting from a few seconds to several 
minutes. The specic events ID and their explanations are listed 
in Table 1 . We follow the original evaluation metric along with 
the pre-dened training/test splits of MED 2011 development set. 
In the pre-processing stage, we empirically sample T 
 20 feature 
vectors for each video clips based on the interpolation functions. 
Besides, each learning-based frame pooling model for individual 
event class is trained with 100 times of iteration ( N 
 100), which 
enables the objective function to be minimized to convergent. Fi- 
nally, the average precision (AP) and the mean average precision 
(mAP) values are used as the evaluation metrics for different pool- 
ing approaches. Mean average precision is dened as the mean AP 
over all events.

3.2. Results on low-level features 

We use the off-the-shelf toolkit VLFeat [25] to extract HOG and 
SIFT features with standard congurations for each frame. The HOG 
features are extracted on each frame with a xed cell size of 8. 
The SIFT descriptors are densely sampled on each frame as well. 
Since the frame size from different V i 
may be different, and thus 
the number of HOG and SIFT descriptors may vary. Therefore, in- 
stead of concatenating HOG and SIFT descriptors in each frame di- 
rectly, the Bag-of-Words method is employed to encode them into 
a xed length vector for each frame with 100 dimensions. The 
codebooks for HOG and SIFT descriptors are generated with the K- 
means method on the training set, respectively. Finally, the results 
are listed in Table 2 . 
From Table 2 , it can be obviously observed that our method is 
effective on most events for both HOG and SIFT features encoded 
with Bag-of-Words method. For the HOG descriptor, our model 
leads to apparent AP improvements on 14 out of 18 events, and our 
learning-based method outperforms the max and average pooling 
strategies by 0.026 and 0.045 in mAP, respectively. As to the SIFT

descriptor, the APs of overall 12 out of 18 events are improved 
by our method and our method outperforms the max and aver- 
age pooling strategies by 0.008 and 0.018 in mAP, respectively. It 
is worth noting that it is very hard to improve mAP, even by 0.01 
since the TRECVID MED 2011 is a very challenging dataset. 

3.3. Results on high-level features 

We test two kinds of high-level features for video frame rep- 
resentation: the CNN-based feature and Object Bank-based feature. 
When it comes to the CNN-based feature, we directly employ the 
vgg-m-128 network [26] , pre-trained on ILSVRC2012 dataset, to ex- 
tract feature on each single frame. In detail, we use the 128 dimen- 
sional fully connected layer feature as the nal feature descrip- 
tor, denoted as ¡°CNN 128d¡±. The Object Bank-based descriptor is 
a combination of several independent ¡°object concept¡± lter re- 
sponses, where we pre-train 10 0 0 Object lters on the ImageNet 
dataset [27] . For each video frame, we employ the maximum re- 
sponse value for each lter as the image-level lter response. Thus, 
each frame is represented with a 10 0 0 dimensional descriptor, de- 
noted as ¡°Max-OB¡±. The experiment results are listed in Table 3 . 
Basically, consistent with the low-level feature descriptors, our 
learning-based pooling method is also effective for both two high- 
level features on most events. For some specic events, the im- 
provements are large using our method. For example, in E008 , the 
event of ¡°Flash mod gathering¡± for object bank-based feature, our 
method improves the AP by more than 0.12 compared with aver- 
age and max pooling methods. Averagely, our method has an im- 
provement of around 0.02 in mAP compared to baseline methods 
for object bank-based feature, while around 0.002 in mAP for CNN- 
based feature. 
From Tables 2 and 3 , we can see that it is hard to determine 
which one of the baseline methods is better. Their performances 
rely heavily on the feature descriptors and event types. In contrast, 
our method performs the best in most cases (and in average). 
In addition to using the CNN-based feature and Object Bank- 
based features as high-level video frame descriptor, we also evalu- 
ate the performance of our optimal pooling strategy using the re- 
cent proposed deep 3D feature: C3D, as a direct spatial-temporal 
level descriptor. The C3D is a simple yet effective spatial-tem poral 
feature learned with 3-dimensional convolutional network (3D

ConvNets). It achieves the-state-of-the-art performance on various 
challenging event detection and recognition datasets, while to the 
best of our knowledge, has not been evaluated on the TRECVID 
MED task. 
In our experiment, the C3D features are extracted with the re- 
leased pre-trained model on the sport1m [28] dataset. The input 
to the network requires a video cuboid, in which the frame size 
¡Á 171 pixels and the temporal length is 16 frames. There- 
is 128 
fore, we cyclically sample to augment each video clip so that its 
length could be multiplied by 16. Then a sliding window with 
length of 16 in temporal domain is employed to scan over the 
augmented video clip. The fully connected layer features are ex- 
tracted and then compressed to 128 dimension via Principal Com- 
ponent Analysis for each 3D video cuboid. We follow the strategy 
to sort, interpolate and sample these cuboid features into 20 fea- 
ture matrix followed by applying Algorithm 1 . The result is listed 
in Table 4 . It is obvious that our optimal pooling approach still has 
obvious improvement than the traditional average and max pool- 
ing counterparts. In 13 out of 18 events, our method achieve better 
performance. However, we also notice that for event E0 06, E0 07 
and E010 , the performances of three pooling strategy are equal. 
This implies that, with strong spatial-temporal features, recogniz- 
ing these three events may not so rely on the absolute value of the 
feature responses. This is also supported by the mAP in Table 4 : 
compared to ¡°Max-OB¡± and ¡°CNN 128d¡± in Table 3 , the C3D feature 
has much higher mAP (around 0.54), which means more powerful 
representative ability. However, the absolute improvement of our 
optimal pooling method over the max and the average pooling is 
0.001, which is not so signicant. The reason may lie on that the 
C3D feature is already a 3D feature incorporating high-level tem- 
poral information. Therefore, the gain from further exploiting its 
potential in the pooling manner of video cuboids may not be as 
large as that of pure frame-level features. 

3.4. Results on fused features 

In addition to using individual low-level and high-level fea- 
ture separately, it is intriguing to further investigate the ability 
of our optimal pooling method with their combinations. From 
Tables 2¨C4 , we nd out that the HOG feature obtains the best 
performance in low-level features, whereas the CNN and C3D fea-

tures obtain outstanding performance among the high-level coun- 
terparts. Thus, we select ¡°HOG+CNN¡± and ¡°HOG+C3D¡± feature com- 
binations using the late fusion strategy. The evaluation results are 
listed in Table 5 . 
As illustrated in Table 5 , in most events, the fused ¡°HOG+CNN¡±
feature combination outperforms using single HOG or CNN sepa- 
rately. The similar observation also applies to the ¡°HOG+C3D¡± com- 
bination: the mAP of our optimal pooling strategy is 0.556, which 
is actually the best performance among all individual features and 
their combinations. Furthermore, we also observe that the num- 
ber of events in which the APs are improved through our optimal 
pooling, increases after fusion. Specically, in the ¡°HOG+C3D¡± fea- 
ture combination, the number of improved events is 17 out of 18 
(except E007 ), in contrast to 14 out of 18 in merely using HOG, 
and 13 out of 18 in merely using C3D. This illustrates that the late 
fusion strategy can further promote our optimal pooling method 
positively.

In order to further evaluate the multiple event classication 
performance, the confusion matrices are drawn using the supe- 

rior feature combinations certied by the previous experiments, 
i.e., the ¡°HOG+CNN¡± and the ¡°HOG+C3D¡± feature combinations. For 
a given video, we employ 18 individual event classiers to vote for 
its scores and later, the event classier which giving out maximum 
classication score assigns its corresponding label for the video. 
Fig. 3 shows their high precisions in classication: most event 
videos in the testing set are correctly classied as the groundtruth 
class, while the error ones tend to randomly distributed across 
other events with few apparent biases. 
In addition, we compare our method to several state-of-the- 
art event detection methods, including HUT [29] , CRF [30] , and 
EODL [10] . All the methods are evaluated on 15 events following 
the ocial training and testing set split of TRECVID MED 2011. As 
shown in Table 6 , it obviously that our optimal pooling strategy 
combined with low-level and spatial-temporal descriptors achieves 
excellent performance, showing an improvement by 0.334. For a 
more fair comparison, we list the results of our method using 
low-level features. As a result, even adopting the simple HOG de- 
scriptor, our method outperforms by 0.03 compared with the sec- 
ond best method. This illustrates the effectiveness of our learning- 
based frame pooling method.

3.5. Visualization of the learned pooling parameters 

In order to get an intuitive observation on the learned pooling 
¦È in several iterations 
parameters, we plot the parameter values of 
of the training process. In detail, we visualize the pooling parame- 
ters in the models of E0 01, E0 02 learned with the HOG descriptor. 
Fig. 4 shows the varying trend of these pooling parameters within 
the 100 iterations. The results illustrate that the weights in some 
feature dimensions increase quickly from the beginning, and 
then converge to stable values. In E002 , the weights gradually 
concentrate in the rst dimension, which reveals the max pooling 
strategy is an optional choice. As to the event E001 , the medium 
feature responses, i.e., the 9th and 10th dimensions in 
¦È , play 
a leading role. It implies that the most crucial weight for event 
detection is not always appearing in the order of the max pooling, 
the min pooling, or the average pooling. 
We additionally compare and visualize the learned weights on 
different events in the last iteration. The visualization results are 
shown in Fig. 5 . In event E002 :¡°Feeding an animal¡± and event E008 : 
¡°Flash mob gathering¡±, features with maximum responses carry 
¦È . In other words, they obtain quite 
the greatest signicance in 
similar weights to the max pooling. However, the learned weights 
are not identical to that of max pooling, since other dimensions 
in 
¦È also get values, whereas they are too small to be seen. This is 
also proved in Table 2 : max pooling yields better mAP than average 
pooling for E002 and E008 with HOG features. In these cases, the 
optimal weights further outperform max pooling because of those 
tiny values in dimensions except the max one, i.e. the rst dimen- 

sion. Besides, the weight distributions of events E0 01, E0 08, E012 
¦È are 
and P002 are scattered, reecting that each dimension in 
indispensable. Overall, the weight distributions of different events 
varies, which illustrates that the focus of video clip changes with 
event categories. 

4. Conclusion 

In this paper, we propose a learning-based frame pooling 
method to address the complex event detection task. Compared 
with commonly used average pooling and max pooling approaches, 
our method can automatically derive the pooling weight among 
frames for each event category. Through visualization, the learned 
weights reveal that weight distributions differ in all event cate- 
gories. Even more, in each event, trivial weight components are 
also non-ignorable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate 
that our approach is more effective and robust for both low-level 
and high-level image descriptors compared with traditional pool- 
ing methods.
