abstract

An experimental investigation on a humidication dehumidication (HDH) desalination system integrated with
a dual purpose solar collector (DPSC) is reported in this work. The DPSC is used to simultaneously heat the water
and air needed for the distillation process. Air ows over the top surface of the absorber plate and the water ows
through the riser tubes, attached in the bottom side of absorber plate. The heated air and water from the collector
is supplied to the humidier, where the air gets humidied and moves towards dehumidier for condensation.
The performance of the system is analyzed by providing semi circular turbulators (convex and concave) in the
air ow eld. The system ability is investigated by varying the ow rate of air, hot water in humidier and cooling
water in dehumidier. The system distillation capacity enhances with the air and water temperature and ow
rate of air, hot water and cold water. The highest productivity of 12.36, 14.14 and 15.23 kg/m2.day is collected
for the without turbulators, convex and concave turbulators in absorber plate respectively. The overall efciency
of the system reaches the value of 67.6% with the concave turbulators in the DPSC.

1. Introduction

Increase in water demand leads to the development different desali-
nation technologies like solar still [1], ash evaporation desalination [2],
multi effect distillation, humidication dehumidication desalination,
vapour compression desalination, freeze desalination and adsorption
desalination [3]. Solar still and solar based humidication dehumidica-
tion desalination technology are suitable for low capacity fresh water
production. Ability of solar still has been improved by minimizing the
water depth, reduction in inclination angle [4], installation of reectors,
coupled with solar collectors, increase in surface area [5] and recovering
of latent heat for preheating the saline water [6].
Pin nned wicks [7] and vertical ns [8] were improved the heat
transfer rate in the solar still and thereby distillate rate. Energy storing
materials increase the basin heat capacity by absorbing the heat during
the sunshine hours and release it in evening or cloudy hours. Solar still
was augmented by adding the materials like sand, black rubber, gravels
[9], phase change material [10], mild steel pieces in basin [11]. Integra-
tion of solar still with the parabolic dish concentrator [12], evacuated
tube solar collector [13] and parabolic concentrator with cover cooling
[14] enhanced the solar still productivity.
The latent heat of condensation was successfully utilized to heat the
upper basin water and thereby augmented the solar still productivity
[15]. Reduction of water mass in upper basin was increased the distillate
output of double basin solar still [16]. Temperature difference between
the evaporation and condensation surface is increased by using the
thermoelectric module in a solar still. It leads to the higher condensation
rate of the system and improved distillate output [17]. A solar still was
tested with a thermoelectric module and increased the production
rate by 3.2 times greater than the conventional one [18]. A solar still
was tested with a separate evaporation and condensation section and
a thermoelectric module for increase the condensation rate [19]. A
CFD analysis was carried out in a tubular solar still and compared with

the experimental results [20]. An attempt was made to improve the per-
formance of single basin solar still by installing partition in basin and
glass cover [21]. A stepped solar still integrated to a humidication de-
humidication process showed better performance with improved dis-
tillate output [22]. Performance of a humidication dehumidication
desalination system was enlightened by connecting with a cascade
solar still [23].
The main reason for lower distillate output in the solar still is the oc-
currence of evaporation and condensation in the same component. In
the HDH system, the humidication and dehumidication process oc-
curs in separate chamber, which ensures the higher distillate compared
to the solar still. The inlet water temperature and humidity plays a vital
role in the performance of HDH system and the distillate was enhanced
with these parameters [24]. Results of the cost optimization analysis
were reported that the solar humidication dehumidication desalina-
tion is a suitable choice for the small scale fresh water production in the
remote arid areas [25]. A two stage humidication desalination system
was experimentally analyzed and found that the two stage system re-
duced the required number of solar collectors and minimized the initial
investment [26]. A desalination system was evaluated with the air ows
over the hot saline water (heated by solar and electrical energy) and ob-
served that the distillate yield was increased with water temperature
[27]. A numerical study to investigate the performance of humidica-
tion desalination system with solar air heater was carried out and the
result indicated that the presence of solar air heater signicantly inu-
enced on the system productivity [28]. A double pass solar air heater
was integrated with the humidication desalination system and noticed
a considerable improvement in the distillate yield [29]. Higher perfor-
mance in humidication desalination system was obtained with the in-
tegration of evacuated tube solar collector [30]. Performance of a
humidication dehumidication desalination system was improved by
using a solar air heater [31]. Developments of low cost and high efcient
solar air heaters reduce the distilled water cost of HDH desalination sys-
tem [32]. Experimental study on bubble column HDH desalination was

carried out by connecting with the solar air heater [33] and dual pur-
pose solar collector [34].
The presence of rib grooves with different angles in absorber plate
showed the higher performance compared to the conventional system
[35]. Impinging of air into the solar collector augments the heat transfer
rate between the air and absorber plate and the higher outlet air tem-
perature was observed [36]. A solar collector was tested and augmented
the outlet air temperature by providing the aluminum cans in absorber
plate [37]. The presence of transverse and inclined ribs on absorber
plate of solar air heater was resulted in the higher effective efciency
[38]. Presence of conical cut out turbulators in the air heater ow eld
enlightened the system ability [39]. A packed bed HDH desalination sys-
tem was tested by using the different ratios of twisted tape inserts, con-
ical cut out turbulators and half perforated circular turbulator in the air
heater. The production rate of the modied system enhanced by 45%
compared to conventional system [40]. Energy and exergy efciency
of the dual purpose solar collector was found to be higher than the sin-
gle purpose solar collector, due to effective utilization of thermal energy
[41]. Three different uid ow channels have been used in a dual pur-
pose solar collector and the higher potential is observed with the rect-
angular n channel [42]. The efciency of the single purpose collector
has been noted that the 3 to 5% lower than the dual purpose collector
[43].
The literature shows that the humidication dehumidication desa-
lination system has greater opportunity for the decentralized fresh
water production over solar still. It is observed that the distillation ca-
pacity of the system enhances with the humidier inlet temperatures.
Also the presence of turbulator enhances the ability of solar collectors
and the dual purpose solar collector is efcient. In most of the previous
works, humidication dehumidication desalination system is integrat-
ed with the different solar collectors (Flat plate solar collector, evacuat-
ed tube collector, parabolic trough collector) to heat the water and air
separately.
Thus an attempt is made in this work to analyze the effect of inte-
grating a dual purpose solar collector with a packed bed HDH desalina-
tion system. The dual purpose collector supplies the required hot water
and hot air for desalination system. Also semi circular turbulators (con-
cave and convex) are used in the air ow passage of a dual purpose solar
collector. It augments the humidier inlet air temperature by means of
creating the turbulence in air ow eld. The performance of the system
is analyzed by varying the mass ow rate of air (0.84 to 1.08 kg/min),
hot water (1 to 3 kg/min) and cooling water (1.5 to 3.5 kg/min).

2. Experimental setup

Schematic and photographic view of the solar packed bed humidi-
cation dehumidication desalination system is shown in the Figs. 1 and

tended as duct on both sides. The dual purpose solar collector setup is
kept in a stand with the inclination of 10°„ which is equal to the latitude

of test place. A 2 mm thickness mild steel plate is used as absorber plate
and the air pumped (by a 1 hp blower) over this plate and gets heated. A
0.5 hp pump supplies the saline water to the dual purpose solar collec-
tor from a storage tank. There are six riser tubes with the diameter of
0.019 m is attached in the back side of the absorber plate as shown in
Fig. 3a. The riser tube inlet is connected with the feed water tank and
the outlet is connected with the humidier spray pipe. The saline
water ows through the riser tubes and gets heated from the absorber
plate. The hot saline water sprayed from the humidier top and the
heated air enters into the bottom of humidier. The humidication
chamber is constructed using the mild steel sheet with the area of
0.09 m2 and with height of 0.5 m in one end and 0.6 m at another
end. The humidier chamber is set with a packing material (jute
cloth) as shown in the Fig. 1. Top cover has the inclination of 10°„ to
guide the condensate and collect in the distillate collection rate. The
hot saline water and the air get contact with the help of packing
materials.

Some of the humid air gets condensed in the top cover and the re-
maining moves to the dehumidier. The dehumidier is a shell and
coil heat exchanger where the humid air ows around the three con-
centric copper coils (0.05 m, 0.08 m, and 0.11 m) and the cooling
water ows through the copper coil in counter direction. These coils
are located in a 0.15 m diameter hollow pipe. Cooling water feed into
the copper coils by using a 0.5 hp pump and three separate ow control
valves are used to control the ow rate. The water in the cooling water
tank is often replaced to maintain the lower cooling water inlet temper-
ature. The experiments are extended by using the semi circular
turbulators in absorber plate in the 6 °¡ 4 zig-zag conguration [44] as
shown in Fig. 3b (convex) and Fig. 3c (concave). In this work, operation-
al range of air ow rate [44], hot water [45] and cold water [45] ow rate
was selected based on the system operational capacity and to give the
maximum system performance. Increasing the hot ow rate beyond
this limit reduces the system capacity. The experiments are carried

3. Uncertainty analysis and data reduction

The temperature at different points in the dual purpose solar collec-
tor, humidier and dehumidier is measured with the help of K type
thermocouples. A hygrometer is used to measure the relative humidity
of ambient air, humid air and dehumidied air. The uncertainty analysis
for the remaining parameters is given in Table 1. Standard uncertainty is
evaluated by the following equation [17,19,46].

4. Results and discussion

The major parameters varied in this study are mass ow rate (MFR)
of air, water and cooling water. The effect of change in these parameters
on the system performance is presented in the Fig. 4. The mass ow rate
of hot water and cooling water is xed and the air ow rate is varied in
the rst set and displayed in the Fig. 4(a). Similarly other two parame-
ters are xed and one is varied in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c). It is observed
that the distillate of the system enhances with the increase in mass
ow rate of air, hot water and cooling water. The increase in mass
ow rate of air enhances the mixing rate in packed bed and also resulted
in the circulation of higher volume of air per unit time in the desalina-
tion system. The improved mixing of air with the water and higher vol-
ume circulation leads to carry the more amount of water vapour with
the air and resulted in the enhanced distillate output. With the increase
in hot water ow rate, the temperature in the humidier raises and

terms of mass ow rate of air, hot water and cooling water in actual
solar condition. It is observed that the system capacity increases with
the ow rate of air, hot and cold water. The presence of turbulator en-
hances the DPSC outlet air temperature and thereby increases the mois-
ture content carrying capacity of air. The air with high specic humidity
is resulted in the enhanced condensation rate. The highest distillate of
15.23, 14.14, and 12.36 kg/m2.d is collected for the concave, convex
and conventional system respectively. The overall efciency of the sys-
tem reaches about 68% with the presence of turbulators in the collector.
The cost of distilled water reaches lowest value of 0.0257 $/kg for the
modied system.

resulted in the higher heat and mass transfer rate between water and
air. It guides to the increase in and higher specic humidity of outlet
air in turn condensation rate (Fig. 4b). The raise in cooling water ow
rate increases the heat transfer rate from the humid air to the water. It
leads to the reduction in outlet humid air temperature and higher distil-
late output. The heat loss from the humid air to cooling water increases
with the ow rate and it leads to the condensation of more water va-
pour from humid air (Fig. 4c). The highest distillate of 15.23 kg/m2.day
is collected with the concave turbulators and which is 23% higher than
the conventional system and 7.7% higher than the convex turbulators
system.
Fig. 5 represents the hourly distillate variation of the system with
and without of turbulators. The average solar radiation for the different
days of experimentation is provided in the Fig. 5. The distillate output of
the system increases with the solar radiation for all congurations and
reaches the maximum at noon and thereafter start to fall. Also it is
noted that the turbulators augment the distillate rate by increasing
the humidier inlet air temperature. The moisture content carrying ca-
pacity of air increases with the air temperature. It leads to the absorp-
tion of higher moisture into air and resulted in the enhanced distillate
output. Also the increase in solar radiation raises the water and air out-
let temperature from the solar collector which is resulted in the higher
system capacity. Concave turbulators create the higher turbulence in
the ow eld rather than the convex turbulators due to the orientation.
The peak hourly distillate of 2.54 kg/m2°§h is obtained when DPSC inte-
grated with the convex turbulator which is 17.6% higher than the with-
out turbulator system.
The overall efciency and distilled water cost of the system is repre-
sented in the Fig. 6. The efciency of the system enhances and the cost of
distilled water decreases with the increase in mass ow rate of air. It
shows that the efciency of the system has a considered impact on
the distilled water cost and this water cost. The system efciency
reaches the maximum value of 68% for concave turbulator conguration
and it is about 55% for without turbulators in the solar collector. The
minimum distilled water cost of 0.032, 0.027 and 0.0257 $/kg is
achieved for the conventional, convex and concave turbulators with
the air ow rate of 0.018 kg/s.

5. Conclusion

bed humidication dehumidication distillation unit. Semi circular
turbulators with the convex and concave shape is used in the dual pur-
pose solar collector to create the turbulence and the performance is
compared with the conventional system. The system is investigated in
