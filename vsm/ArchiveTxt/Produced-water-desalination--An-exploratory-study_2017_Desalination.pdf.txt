abstract

Produced water is the largest volume byproduct stream in oil and gas production, and has an adverse
environmental impact due to its complex composition and high disposal costs. Membrane fouling due
to hydrocarbons limits purication of produced water by reverse osmosis (RO). A novel hybrid adsorp-
tion/ion exchange (IEX)/RO process is developed in which the adsorber removes dissolved hydrocarbons,
IEX removes scale causing precursors, and RO desalinates the water. A part of the hydrocarbon free liquid
from the adsorber is pressurized to 6.2 bar, heated to 160  C and used to regenerate the adsorber, which
resulted in an improvement in water recovery (to 86%), and translated into a predicted 22.8% decrease in
costs amounting to US$ 27 million annual savings. The new high water recovery processes delineated in
this work provide an array of novel options for removing hydrocarbons and desalination under different
conditions. Experimental studies are needed to verify the assumptions made in this analysis.

1. Introduction

The term ※Produced Water§ is used to describe the water from
oil and gas (O&G) extraction processes. Water is frequently injected
into wells to increase oil recovery. Steam is injected to decrease the
viscosity of oil resulting in improved owability. Liquid water con-
taining surfactants is used to help release oil adhering to the rock
matrix, and high pressure water containing additives and partic-
ulates is used in fracking to increase the rock porosity. The O&G
(＞7 bbl of water per bbl of oil). It is the largest volume byproduct
industry in USA produces about 18 billion bbls of produced water
stream associated with O&G production (75 billion bbls of produced
water) worldwide annually. Note: 1 bbl = 42 US gal) [1,2].
Management of produced water presents environmental chal-
lenges and costs ($0.30/bbl每$105.00/bbl depending on the disposal
method [3]). The major hydrocarbon groups present in produced
water include alkanes, aromatics, polynuclear aromatics, hydro-
carbon compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur and
unknown hydrocarbons (oil & grease). Produced water also contains
high amounts of dissolved salts with predominant cations such as
Na + , K + , Ca2 + and Mg2 + ; anions such as Cl  and SO2
4 , and silica
(SiO2 ) [4].
A clarication step is used to remove particulates and induced gas
otation (IGF) is used to remove free oil. The most common method
to remove emulsied oil is by pH adjustment and coagulation. A key
disadvantage of this method is the problem of additives affecting
the downstream operations. When large volumes of produced water
 treated, chemical addition may increase the cost signicantly [5].
Other methods such as electro-coagulation and hydrocyclones are
also used. Electrocoagulation involves the use of extremely high volt-
ages, and can become expensive as scale of operation increases.
Hydrocyclones are ecient for some emulsions but are capital inten-
sive and expensive to run and maintain [1,2,6].
Membrane processes have emerged as an alternative. The key
advantages of membrane based processes are low operating cost,
the absence of chemical addition and subsequent generation of oily
sludge. However, mineral scale deposition and fouling on the mem-
brane surface (membrane fouling) is a critical issue which limits
the water recovery. The hydrocarbons present in produced water
adsorb on the membrane surface and form a foulant layer that causes
permeate ux decline. In addition, aromatic hydrocarbons are poten-
tially damaging to the polysulfone support layer of the membrane.
Antiscalants have been used to avoid scaling on the membrane and
increase the water recovery to a certain extent. However antis-
calant addition promotes biofouling because antiscalants have been
designed to be biodegradable to make concentrate disposal environ-
mentally friendly [7每9].
Hodgkiess et al. [9] studied the impact of hydrocarbons on RO
membranes. Their studies involved crude oil/water, diesel/water
mixtures and hexane/water emulsied/single phase mixtures. They
found that exposure to diesel/water emulsied mixtures was
extremely damaging to the membranes. After just 30 min of expo-
sure to dilute diesel water mixtures of 1/50 or 1/100 ratios, they
observed greater than 50% reduction in permeate ux and greater
than 100% increase in salt passage. Hexane also caused serious dete-
rioration of the performance of RO membranes when in contact in
pure or emulsied form. However, no changes in ux or salt pas-
sage were observed in single phase oil/hexane/water solutions. From
the experimental studies of Hodgkiess et al. [9], and for the hydro-
carbons studied, it can be inferred that hydrocarbons retained in
aqueous solution do not have damaging impact on performance of
RO membranes while hydrocarbons in pure or emulsied form or
concentrated hydrocarbon mixtures have a deleterious impact on the
membranes. Due to this incompatibility between the raw produced
water and the RO membrane, pretreatment is essential to eliminate
the problematic hydrocarbons, hardness, metals, oil and grease.
RO desalination processes with an adsorption pretreatment and
an ion exchange (IEX) water softening treatment after the IGF
unit are proposed in this paper. Adsorption processes are capable
of removing iron, manganese, total organic carbon, hydrocarbons,
heavy metals (>80% removal eciency) and oil from produced water
thereby alleviating the problem of fouling [3]. Activated carbon has
been used extensively for municipal water treatment as a process for
removal of organics from drinking water. Based on tonnage used and
market value, activated carbon is one of the most widely used porous
adsorbents. Organoclay materials such as bentonite can also be used,
however they do not have the same adsorption capability as acti-
vated carbon [10]. Although activated carbon is the market standard
for water treatment, synthetic polymeric adsorbents such as DOWEX
OPTIPORE L/V 493 offer advantages in specic cases. Synthetic poly-
meric adsorbents can be used for recovery of organics from water for
identication and quantication purposes [11]. IEX treatment will
remove the scale causing precursors in water such as Ca2 + and Mg2 + ,
thereby alleviating the problem of mineral scaling on the surface of
RO membranes. The concentrate from the RO unit will be used to

regenerate the IEX column which would then eliminate the need for
external regeneration chemicals. If the water to be treated does not
have any scale causing precursors, then an IEX pretreatment might
not be required. The water from the IGF and the adsorbers, would
directly be sent to the RO.
Modeling of IEX and RO, and development of RO/IEX hybrid sys-
tems for desalination of concentrated brackish waters at municipal
plant scale and desalination of the Colorado River water at the YUMA
plant scale were done by Venkatesan and Wankat [12每15]. As the
modeling of IEX and RO cascades has been done extensively, the
main focus of this paper will be the modeling of the adsorption unit
and its integration with the RO/IEX system. The hydrocarbons con-
sidered in this paper were aromatic compounds and, classied as
mono- and polycyclic depending on number of equivalent benzene
rings. These compounds are described in Table 1. Toluene was used
to represent BTEX as it is close to the average molecular weight for
this class of compounds. Naphthalene (for NPD class of compounds)
and anthracene (for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, PAH) were
selected because data was available.
After describing the process, the modeling of the adsorber and
adsorber results are presented followed by an evaluation of different
heating methodologies. As the modeling of RO/IEX has been covered
extensively previously [12每15], the focus of the current modeling
efforts are on the adsorber and the different heating methodolo-
gies employed. Finally, the different operations are integrated into
one process and the overall results are presented. The evaluations of
RO/IEX models are presented along with the overall results.

2. Process description

In this section, a brief description about the proposed process is
given. The composition of a particular raw produced water (Texas,
USA) is listed in Table 2. After pretreatment to remove suspended
solids, the incoming water (≡80  C) is sent to an IGF unit. In IGF, the
water is de-oiled and almost all of the oil droplets and, the straight
and branched chain hydrocarbons are removed at this stage (>98%
removal eciency). The injection of gas bubbles into the water phase
increases the buoyant force on the oil droplets. The oil droplets are
removed when they rise to the water surface. The water composition
after clarication and IGF is also shown in Table 2. This pretreat-
ment does not remove the emulsied and dissolved hydrocarbons,
especially lighter aromatics as their solubility is higher than that of
straight/branched chain hydrocarbons.
Dow FILMTEC SW30XLE-400i RO membranes were used in this
study. These are typically used for two-pass seawater designs and
high TDS brackish water applications. These membranes have a
higher maximum operating pressure (83 bar) than FT-SW30HR (＞70
bar) and FT-BW30HR (＞40 bar) membranes. As the membranes,
SW30XLE, SW30HR, and BW30HR are spiral-wound elements made
of polyamide thin-lm composites, they are all susceptible to the
problem of membrane fouling due to hydrocarbons [11]. Therefore,
before sending the water from IGF to RO for desalination, a check
for hydrocarbon solubility and mineral salt precipitation is done
by PHREEQC [16]. This check determines the maximum possible
recovery at which the RO can be operated without mineral scale for-
mation or hydrocarbon fouling on the membrane surface. Presence of
emulsied hydrocarbons quickly fouls the membrane and prevents

operation of RO. As a pretreatment, the de-oiled water is cooled (＞45
 C) and then sent to an adsorber packed with granular activated car-
bon (TOG 20 ℅ 50). Alternatively, the de-oiled water from IGF can be
sent to the adsorber without cooling. However, the discharge from
the adsorber must then be cooled before sending to RO since oper-
ating at temperatures greater than 45  C will void the membrane
manufacturer＊s warranty [11].
The single adsorber column shown in Fig. 1 represents a num-
ber of columns in parallel. The adsorbers are in parallel to handle the
large owrate and allow for operation in a cyclic fashion involving a

feed step, a regeneration step and a cooling step. In all the gures,
only the important heat exchangers are shown. Each adsorber con-
sists of a horizontal column with vertical ow through a relatively
shallow packed bed of granular activated carbon (Fig. 2). Horizontal
columns are commonly used for solvent recovery from gases using
activated carbon as adsorbent [17]. During the feed step, hydro-
carbons (BTEX, NPD and PAH) are adsorbed on the highly porous
activated carbon and the discharge from the adsorber is stripped
of hydrocarbons. The discharge from the adsorber is split into four
streams as shown in Fig. 1. An alternative that will be discussed later
is to have adsorbers in series in addition to parallel.

2.1. Stream 1 (regenerant)
This stream is heated to 160  C and its pressure elevated to 6.2
bar before it is sent to the adsorber as regenerant. Temperature is ele-
vated in order to desorb the hydrocarbons from the activated carbon

(adsorbent) while pressure is increased to prevent boiling. Heating
and pressurization is done either by direct injection of steam from
a pressurized boiler or by heat exchangers (HEX) and pumps. Dur-
ing the regeneration step the hot, high pressure water shifts the
isotherms such that the hydrocarbons present on the bed are des-
orbed. Depending on their solubilities at 160  C, a supersaturated
solution may be formed during regeneration when the hydrocar-
bons (BTEX, NPD and PAH) are released from the adsorbent and
enter the water. A supersaturated solution may result in formation
of droplets of hydrocarbons which would interfere with xed bed
operation. Thus, regeneration is done counterow to the feed in
an expanded bed at an upward velocity such that the hydrocarbon
droplets formed are carried out of the column through overow (as
they follow a streamline), while the much larger adsorbent parti-
cles remain in the column with negligible carryover. If experimental
data show that droplets are not formed, then a packed bed can
be used with upward ow during feed and downward ow during
regeneration and cooling.
When the hot, high pressure regenerant is pumped in the column
counter ow to the feed, the liquid exiting the column remains at the
feed concentration and temperature until temperature breakthrough
occurs. This euent is depressurized and recycled to the adsorber
column as feed for the next cycle.

2.2. Stream 2 (cooling)

Before the next feed cycle begins, the column is depressurized
as the feed is at low pressure. However, since the column is at
160  C and 6.2 bar at the end of regeneration, a reduction in pressure
will cause ashing of water inside the column, unless the column
is cooled before the pressure is reduced. The amount of regenerant
and Stream 2 is such that the maximum temperature in the column,
after it is depressurized (to 1 bar), does not exceed the boiling point
of water at 1 bar, i.e., 99.6  C. When Stream 2 is pumped into the col-
umn, the euent is the spent regenerant. To partially offset pumping
costs, a pressure exchanger is used to depressurize the entire eu-
ent from regeneration and cooling steps, and, the energy recovered
is used to partially pressurize the regenerant stream.

2.3. Stream 3 (feed to RO/IEX system)
This stream is cooled to 45  C and sent to a system of RO cascades
with IEX water softening pretreatment as shown in Fig. 1. The IEX
exchanges the scale causing precursors such as Ca2 + , Mg2 + , Ba2 +
and Sr2 + with Na + thereby alleviating the problem of mineral scal-
ing on the membrane. This system is very similar to the previous
work [12,13]. Alternatively, Stream 3 can be sent to a system of RO
cascades with intermediate IEX water softening as shown in Fig. 1.
For the regeneration of IEX column, the concentrate from the RO cas-
cade is used. The product water from different cascades is mixed in
order to achieve a water stream of desired purity.

2.4. Stream 4 (optional bypass)
This stream is cooled to 45  C and mixed with the product water
coming from the RO cascades. Depending on the purity of product
water desired, the amount of bypass stream is adjusted.
The different alternatives evaluated are as follows:

The adsorber is operated as a packed column in the feed step
and as an expanded bed in desorption step. The simplied governing
mass and energy balance equations, shown in Eqs. (1a) and (1b), are
solved using Aspen Chromatography 2006. In order to describe the
adsorption equilibrium of a single solute, the Langmuir isotherm is
used.

is accounted for by lm diffusion. The correlation by Wilson and
Geankoplis [21] is used to estimate lm mass transfer coecients in
packed beds (Eq. (1c)) and the correlation by Rowe [22] (Eq. (1d)) is
used for expanded beds.

As the adsorber is operated under non-isothermal conditions, the
effect of variation in temperature has been considered, but the tor-
tuosity factor has been assumed constant. Molecular diffusivity was
correlated by the equation of King et al. [23].
To benchmark the proposed model, simplistic cases of single
and binary component adsorption on activated carbon were ana-
lyzed [15]. For the single component benchmarking, the adsorption
of benzene from aqueous solution onto activated carbon was used.
The physical properties and references for the activated carbon
parameters used for simulation are listed in Table 3. The heats of
adsorption of all compounds on activated carbon are assumed to
be equal and the maximum saturation capacities of all compounds
on activated carbon are assumed to be equal. A mixture of benzene
and toluene using the multicomponent Langmuir isotherm was the
model system for the case of binary multicomponent adsorption [24].

As the scale of the process is huge, 250 million gallons (US) per

during the feed step. All the feed columns are operated with the
same linear velocity as listed in Table 4. At the start we have one col-
umn feeding. Once breakthrough occurs, a new column starts feeding
and the saturated column starts regenerating. Since the regeneration
time is less than feed time, with two columns the regenerated col-
umn would sit idle until the feeding column is saturated. The number
of columns should be large enough that at any given time we do not
have idle columns. The feasible number of columns such that no col-
umn is idle is found from Eq. (4). For example, at cyclic steady state,
we might have 14 columns feeding and two columns regenerating
simultaneously. When one column becomes saturated, it immedi-
ately starts regenerating and a regenerated column starts feeding.

3.2. Results for single adsorption columns in parallel

Although the adsorber was retrotted to the RO/IEX network, for
presentation purposes the adsorber design and results are decoupled
from those of RO/IEX.
The produced water from IGF has a TDS of 7500 ppm. The pri-
mary hydrocarbons present are; BTEX (1500 l g/L), NPD (720 l g/L)
and PAH (85 l g/L). Using a solubility check [15], it was determined
that the produced water from IGF unit requires pretreatment before
being sent to the RO. Hence, the produced water from IGF is sent to
the adsorber packed with activated carbon. The breakthrough curves
at the end of the feed step at cyclic steady state are shown in Fig. 3.
Note, the ordinate in Fig. 3 is in logarithmic scale. The x-coordinate
represents time at cyclic steady state. As BTEX compounds are less
adsorbed than PAH, BTEX breakthrough occurs earlier than PAH
breakthrough. The NPD compounds are intermediate between BTEX
and PAH, and hence their breakthrough occurs before PAH but after
BTEX. Operating times are listed in Table 5. The BTEX, NPD, and PAH
removal eciencies were close to 99.95%.

Fig. 4. Feed enters at the top of the bed (Axial distance z=0) and exits
at the bottom (Axial distance z=150) while the regenerant and cool-
ing uid enter at z=150 and exit at z=0. At the end of regeneration
and cooling, the column is not completely regenerated and a heel of
concentrated BTEX and NPD is left at the top of the bed. This helps
minimize the use of regenerant and cooling water. The heel shown
in Fig. 4 might be expected to cause BTEX and NPD to exit during the
feed step. However, after the low temperature feed enters the col-
umn, the equilibrium shifts and both BTEX and NPD are adsorbed on
the activated carbon.

3.3. Two columns in series

Use of multiple columns in series has several advantages which
necessitates its evaluation as an alternative to adsorption in single
column. With two columns in series, the biggest advantages are
reduction in total adsorbent compared to a single column and pro-
ducing a more concentrated waste [17]. The reduction in total adsor-
bent and the amount of waste leads to potential economic benets,
especially when the waste disposal costs are high. The potential
drawbacks are as follows [17]:

 Increase in total number of columns and a potential increase in

times are faster due to shorter duration of operation in each

in the bottom column. The bed depths were adjusted so that these
conditions were met and the waste was concentrated.
At low bed depths (<0.3 m), the top column is saturated but
breakthrough of hydrocarbons occurs in the bottom column because
the length of the mass transfer zone is greater than bed depth and
breakthrough time is less than feed time. At higher bed depths (>0.3
m), the breakthrough of hydrocarbons does not occur from the bot-
tom bed, but the top bed is not saturated. A bed depth of 0.3 m is
found to be optimum since breakthrough of hydrocarbons does not
occur from the bottom bed and the top bed is near saturation [15].
The operation at two consecutive cycles for two columns feed-
ing in series is shown in Fig. 5. The rst cycle ends when Bed 1 is
almost saturated; breakthrough hasn＊t happened in Bed 2 and Bed 3
is regenerated (Fig. 5 (a)). In the next cycle, feed is sent to Bed 2 and
the euent from Bed 2 goes to Bed 3. Bed 1 is regenerated by the
time Bed 2 is almost saturated and breakthrough has not happened
in Bed 3 (Fig. 5 (b)). The adsorption column specications are listed
in Table 5.

The exit concentration of PAH slightly increases and then
decreases (small hump as noticed in Fig. 3). The maximum concen-
tration of this hump is much less than the feed concentration of PAH.
Because the concentrations of BTEX and NPD are much higher than
the concentration of PAH (the ratio of BTEX and NPD concentration
to PAH concentration is O(102 )) and the isotherms are competi-
tive, some of the PAH is desorbed by BTEX and NPD. But as the
KPAH = K﹢,PAH ℅ exp
Langmuir isotherm parameter
of PAH
(0.036 L/mg) is higher than that of BTEX (0.013 L/mg) and NPD (0.022
L/mg), the desorption of PAH by BTEX and NPD is minimal.
If the produced water at 80  C from the IGF is cooled and then
sent to the adsorber, the adsorption behavior changes. The break-
through of BTEX, NPD and PAH occurs later since at lower temper-
atures, adsorption is higher. However, there is a decrease in mass
transfer coecient at lower temperatures which slightly alters the
breakthrough curves.
The regenerant to the adsorber is at 160  C and 6 bar. When
the regenerant is pumped in the column counterow to the feed,
the euent is at feed concentration until the thermal wave breaks
through. This euent is depressurized and recycled back to the col-
umn as feed for the next cycle [13]. The column is not completely
regenerated, and a heel of BTEX and NPD is left. A cooling step
(Stream 2) is included to prevent ashing of water in the column
when the column is depressurized. When Stream 2 is pumped coun-
terow to the feed, the temperature in the column drops. In order to
minimize the use of Stream 2, a temperature heel is left such that the
perature of water at 1 bar (99.6  C). The temperature prole and the
maximum temperature in the column is less than the boiling tem-
concentration of different hydrocarbons (in the bed) at the end of
regeneration and cooling step at cyclic steady state is illustrated in

3.4. Results for two columns in series

The breakthrough curves at the end of the feed step at cyclic
steady state for a bed depth of 0.3 m are shown in Fig. 6. Note, the
ordinate in Fig. 6 is in logarithmic scale.The abscissa is the time at
cyclic steady state. BTEX breakthrough occurs before NPD and PAH.
The column concentration and temperature prole at the end of
regeneration and cooling step at cyclic steady state are illustrated
in Fig. 7. Similar to Fig. 4, a temperature heel is left in Fig. 7, such
that the maximum temperature in the column is less than the boil-
ing temperature of water at 1 bar (99.6  C) in order to minimize the
use of coolant.
The euent prole from the regenerated adsorber column is
shown in Fig. 8. The rst part of the euent is at the feed concen-
tration and after cooling is recycled back to the adsorber for the next
feed cycle. The remaining euent is cooled and then sent to a phase
separator where the hydrocarbons are separated from water. The
water is then sent for re-injection. Alternatively, it can be sent back
to the IGF, with a small purge stream taken off to prevent buildup of
impurities. Note: this waste stream is not mixed with the brine com-
ing from the RO cascade since the disposal strategies are different for
these streams.

4. Evaluation of heating methodologies

In order to elevate the temperature of the discharge water from
the adsorber (after the feed step), two methods can be employed.
Both methods; direct injection of steam from high pressure boilers
and indirect heating by heat exchangers were evaluated.

4.1. Direct injection of steam
In the current process, high pressure steam (7 bar, 165  C) from
the boiler was used to elevate the temperature of a fraction of dis-
charge from the adsorber. Prior to heating by steam injection, the
discharge stream from the adsorber was pressurized to 6 bar. Steam
at higher pressure is used in order to prevent any backow. The nal
temperature desired is Tnal = 160  C. The amount of steam required
was calculated as

步mSteam [k+cpw (TSteam Tnal )] = 步mWater ,in cpw (Tnal Tin ) 步QFeed,Cool (5a)

cpw is the specic heat capacity of liquid water (kJ/kg K), k is the
latent heat of vaporization (kJ/kg) while 步mWater ,in represents the mass
owrate of water leaving the adsorber that is used for regeneration
and 步mSteam (kg/hr) is the required mass owrate of steam. 步QFeed,Cool
is the heat released when the water from IGF is cooled before send-
ing it to the adsorber. This heat is used to reheat the discharge from
the adsorber (feed step) before pumping it back as regenerant. If

eration/cooling step at cyclic steady state. Two columns in series, feed temperature =
cooling temperature: 80  C.

the produced water from IGF is not cooled, then 步QFeed,Cool = 0. If x
fraction of discharge from the adsorber is used for regeneration,

步mWater ,in = QFeed,ADS ℅ qwater ℅ x

(5b)

where QFeed,ADS is the feed owrate to the adsorber. The steam com-
pletely condenses and the total owrate of water going as regenerant
is

步mSteam + 步mWater ,in = QReg ℅ qwater

(5c)

If QCool is the volumetric owrate of the cooling water pumped
in the adsorber for a duration of tCool and if tReg is the duration of
the regeneration step, then the amount of water leaving the adsorber
and going to the RO/IEX system is

QFeed,RO/IEX =

QFeed,ADS tfeed  QReg tReg  QCool tCool
tFeed

(5d)

A drawback of heating by direct injection of steam is that make
up water must be added to the boiler because water is continuously
consumed. For medium pressure boilers (50 ≒ P ≒300 psi) the feed
to boiler must have TDS ≒3500 ppm with maximum alkalinity of 700
ppm and with maximum hardness 15 ppm [32]. Hence, a part of
the product water from the RO mixed with the discharge from IEX
(from the feed step) was used as feed to the boiler. A mass balance

is written around the boiler (Eq. (5e)), and as total hardness is the
limiting factor, a total hardness balance is also written (Eq. (5f)).

(5f)

4.2. Indirect heating by heat exchangers (HEX)

Shell and tube heat exchangers are commonly used in the oil
and gas industries as they are suited for higher-pressure applica-
tions [33]. Shell and tube heat exchanger design is standardized by
the Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association (TEMA) [34]. Pro-
cess schematics are shown in Figs. 9 and 10, for when the feed is
cooled and not cooled respectively.
The amount of heat released in cooling the feed to the adsorber
and the area of the HEX needed are computed as

步QFeed,Cool = QFeed,ADS qwater cpw (TIGF  TFeed ) = UAFT DTLM,Countercurrent

(6a)

where TIGF is the temperature of discharge from the IGF unit and TFeed
is the temperature of the feed to the adsorber. With the help of utility
water and HEX, the heat released in cooling the feed is used to partly
heat the discharge from the adsorber (Fig. 10). Multipass HEX with
counter-current ow is used in order to achieve heat transfer. The
rate of heat transfer is then given by

步QHEX = UAFT DTLM,Countercurrent = QReg qwater cpw (TReg ,out  TReg ,in )
= 步mSteam [k + cpw (TSteam,in  TSteam,out )]

(6b)

U is the overall heat transfer coecient, FT (=0.85) is the cor-
rection factor for multipass exchangers [34], and DTLM,Countercurrent is
the log-mean temperature difference. Design details are presented
elsewhere [15].

4.3. Results

The effects of different methods of heating and different feed tem-
peratures on HEX area, utility and steam requirements, and, the net
ow to RO/IEX system are tabulated in Table 6. When direct injection
of steam is used, the HEX area and steam requirements are lower,
and, the ow to RO/IEX system is higher, as compared to the case
when indirect heating is employed. This is because, direct injection of
steam results in a lower fraction of discharge from adsorber (Stream
1) used for regeneration, which corresponds to lesser amount of
steam required. When direct injection of steam is used, no HEX is
needed for the regenerant stream (Stream 1). Hence, the HEX area
is also lower. Additionally, a lower fraction of discharge (Stream 1)
implies that a higher fraction of discharge from the adsorber goes to
the RO/IEX system (Stream 3).

5. Economic analysis

The cost analysis for the IEX and RO units is a feasibility study
that follows the methodology as described by Venkatesan and
Wankat [12每14]. This type of cost analysis is expected to give
answers within ㊣25% of actual cost [34], although for comparison
of similar processes the results are somewhat more accurate since
systematic errors will tend to be similar in both designs.
The additional unit operations addressed in this paper are adsor-
bers and heat exchangers. Carbon steel is used for the construction
of adsorber columns and its capital cost (ccADS ) is calculated in the
same way as the capital cost of the IEX column [15]. As the adsor-
ber column is operated at an elevated temperature and pressure,
its thickness is designed to handle the operating conditions. The
minimum thickness (e) is calculated as [35]

e =

eAtm =

PiDi
2f  Pi
0.101 ℅ Di

(7)

(8)

where Pi is the internal pressure (N/mm2 ), Di is the internal diameter
(m), and f is the design stress (N/mm2 ) of the material of construc-
tion under the operating conditions. Typically the thickness of the
column is set to e + 2. The extra 2 mm is added to account for corro-
sion. For most applications under atmospheric conditions, a nominal

thickness based on the design stress and the internal diameter is
used [35]. The cost of granular activated carbon (ccactcarbon ) for water
treatment is US$ 85/ft3 [36]. The column thickness is computed from
Eq. (7) and found to be 10 mm. As illustrated in Fig. 11, the total cost
of adsorption (ccADS + ccactcarbon ) decreases with increase in number
of columns (ignoring the cost of end ttings). The costs have been
updated to December 2012.
Shell and tube multipass heat exchangers with U-tubes are used
in the proposed process. Most published purchase-cost data are cor-
related in terms of heat exchange surface area (usually based on
the outside surface area of the tubes) for a base case design, with
correction factors only for pressure and materials for the shell and
tubes [34]. In some cases, corrections for tube length are given. How-
ever, for the purpose of this work, tube length corrections have not
been taken into account. The base cost for a shell and tube exchanger
is given by [34]

CB = exp{11.147  0.9186[ln(A)] + 0.0979[ln(A)]2 }

(9a)

where A is the surface area in square feet. The purchase cost is
determined by [34]

ccHEX = FP FM CB

(9b)

where FM is a material factor for various combinations of tube and
shell materials and is given as a function of surface area A in square
feet

For carbon steel shell and tubes, a = 0 and b = 0. The pressure
factor, FP , is based on the shell side pressure, P, in psig and is given
by [34]

FP = 0.9803 + 0.018

The entire process is designed to handle a total feed of 250 Mgpd.
A capital recovery factor (CRF) of 15% was used in order to con-
vert total capital cost into an annual operating cost. To account for
the brine from the IEX, a high brine disposal cost (BDC) of US$
6.29/m3 [37], a low cost of US$ 0.29/m3 [38] and an average of high
and low costs were used. To account for the waste from the ADS, a
high waste disposal cost (WDC) of US$ 25.29/m3 [39,40], a low cost
of US$ 5.16/m3 [39,40] and an average of high and low costs were
used. The brine from IEX and the waste from the adsorber columns
are not mixed. The total disposal cost is calculated as

TDC = BDC ℅ QBrine,IEX + WDC ℅ QWaste,ADS

(10a)

where QBrine,IEX and QWaste,ADS represent the volume of brine from IEX
and waste from adsorber sent to their respective disposal units. In
order to facilitate economic analysis, an average of the brine disposal
and waste disposal cost per unit volume (DC) is considered.

DC =

In order to nd the disposal cost where change in the optimal
process takes place, a quick estimate is done. The tipping points are

The overall recovery and the cost of product water are summarized
in Tables 7 and 8 for three brine and waste disposal costs and for the
same product water concentration (＞400 ppm).
The economic impact of the different alternatives evaluated in
this work (listed in Section 2) are sequentially analyzed below.

6.1. Adsorber feed temperature
Feed temperatures of 45  C and 80  C were systematically evalu-
ated (Figs. 10 and 11). At 45  C, adsorption is stronger which makes
the solute wave move slower and hence increases the amount of feed
water processed. At low feed temperatures, the regenerant stream
feed temperatures (80  C), adsorption is weaker which makes the
has to be heated through a greater temperature difference. At high
solute wave move faster and thereby reduces the amount of feed pro-
cessed. At high feed temperatures the regenerant stream has to be
heated through a smaller temperature difference. The cost analyses
in Tables 7 and 8 consistently show a lower cost for the 80  C feed
temperature, but all of the differences are less than 10% and most
are less than 5% of the 80  C cost. Thus, although the higher temper-
ature feed is probably more economical, the analysis is not accurate
enough to prove this.

6.2. Adsorber column conguration

A single adsorber column was compared with two adsorber
columns feeding in series. A single adsorber column uses higher
quantities of adsorbent but fewer columns. Two adsorber columns
feeding in series reduces the amount of adsorbent but increases the
number of columns. As the adsorbent is activated carbon, the cost of
the adsorbent is less than the cost of the columns (Section 5). The
predominant capital cost is the column.
Operation with two adsorber columns feeding in series (Fig. 12)
generates a waste stream which is more concentrated and of less
volume [15]. Hence at high disposal costs, it is benecial to have a
two columns in series conguration, since a reduction in the volume
of waste pays for the excess capital cost. However, at low disposal
costs, it is not benecial to have a two columns in series congu-
ration, since a reduction in the volume of waste is not sucient to
pay for the increased capital. In this scenario, it is better to use a sin-
gle column conguration. The results in Tables 7 and 8 agree with
the qualitative analysis, but the differences in costs are quite small
(often 1% to 2%), which is less than the error in the cost comparison.
If a more expensive adsorbent is used two columns in series could be
less expensive than a single column at low disposal costs.

6.3. Heating methodology

Heating by direct injection of steam (Figs. 1 and 12) and by heat
exchangers (HEX, Figs. 10 and 11) were evaluated in this work. Equal
amount of waste is generated from the adsorber column when either
direct injection of steam or HEX is used to heat the regenerant stream
(Stream 1). When direct injection of steam is used, the net amount
of water going to the RO/IEX system is higher (Stream 3), which
results in an increased capital cost (of RO/IEX), and an increase in
the amount of product water from RO. However, part of the product

in series to a single adsorber, and, from IEX pretreatment to inter-
mediate IEX. For a rough estimate, it was assumed that the adsorber
and the RO/IEX system can be decoupled and are independent. At the
tipping point for adsorber, the money saved by reduction in amount
of waste from the adsorber by using columns in series equals the
increase in capital cost. Similarly, at the tipping point for RO/IEX con-
guration, the money saved by reduction in amount of brine equals
the increased capital and operating cost (excluding brine disposal).
The disposal costs at the tipping points act as decision variables. If
the tipping point lies in between the high and the low disposal costs

(WDCLow < WDCTipping < WDCHigh and BDCLow < BDCTipping <

BDCHigh ) then the optimal processes for the high and low disposal
costs are different. However, if the tipping point lies either below the
low disposal cost or above the high disposal cost, then the optimal
process is the same for the entire range of disposal costs considered.

The overall recovery of the entire process (hOverall ) based on fresh

water is recycled to the boiler as make up water, in order to compen-
sate for the loss of steam due to condensation and mixing with the
regenerant stream.
When HEX is used to heat the regenerant stream, there is no con-
densation and loss of steam due to mixing. Hence, the net amount of
water going to the RO/IEX system is lower which results in a slightly
smaller capital cost (of RO/IEX), and a slight reduction in the amount
of product water from RO. As there is no loss of steam, make up water
is not required. However, there is an additional capital cost of HEX.
The increase in capital of RO/IEX (when direct injection of steam is
used) is two orders of magnitude greater than the increase in capital
due to HEX [15]. Thus, use of HEX appears to be better than heating
by direct injection of steam in all cases, but the differences (all less
than 7%) are less than the error in the economic analyses.

6.4. RO/IEX system conguration

IEX pretreatment (IEX-RO, Fig. 1) and Intermediate IEX (PRO-IEX-
SRO, Fig. 12) were the two system congurations evaluated.
In the IEX-RO conguration, the entire discharge from the adsor-
ber (Stream 3 in Fig. 1) goes to the IEX columns (since there is no
bypass), thereby greatly increasing the capital cost of IEX. As there
is no reduction of amount of water in the IEX, the discharge from
the IEX going to the RO is high, thereby resulting in an increase in
the capital of RO. In PRO-IEX-SRO, the discharge from the adsorber
after bypass (Stream 3 in Fig. 12) goes to the PRO thereby result-
ing in a large PRO conguration. Only a reduced amount of water
(brine from PRO) goes to the IEX, thereby resulting in smaller and
fewer IEX columns and reduced amount of IEX resin. The capital and
operating cost of RO in IEX-RO conguration is greater than that in

PRO-IEX-SRO system. The capital cost of IEX is greater in the IEX-RO
conguration while the operating cost of IEX is fairly negligible in
both alternatives.
As the overall recovery of PRO-IEX-SRO is greater than that of
IEX-RO, the amount of brine disposed is smaller in the former. Thus,
when the disposal costs are high, it is benecial to operate at higher
recovery (PRO-IEX-SRO). With bypass, the capital of PRO-IEX-SRO is
less than that of IEX-RO; thus, the former is better even when dis-
posal costs are low. Thus, in either case, it is benecial to employ the
PRO-IEX-SRO conguration. The cost results shown in Tables 7 and 8
agree with this prediction, and in many of the cases the cost differ-
ence is greater than 20%, which is probably greater than the error in
comparing similar processes.
From Eqs. (10c) and (10d), WDCTipping and BDCTipping were found
to be US$ 5.89/m3 and US$ 3.24/m3 (not possible) respectively.
From the obtained values, it is clear that WDCTipping is close to
WDCLow and there is no tipping point for the RO/IEX system; thus,
the PRO-IEX-SRO conguration is always the best. The optimal RO
congurations are delineated in Table 9, and the IEX column speci-
cations are summarized in Table 10.
Summary of cost analysis:

 For all disposal costs, an adsorber feed temperature of 80  C
appears to be the optimal feed condition although this result is
 For all disposal costs, heating of the regenerant stream by HEX
within the expected error in the cost analysis.
appears to be more economical than direct steam injection
although this result is within the expected error in the cost
analysis.

 For high and average disposal costs, a process with two adsor-
bers in series appears to be the optimal solution while for
low disposal costs the single adsorber process appears optimal.
These effects are smaller than the probable error.
 The PRO-IEX-SRO conguration is the optimal RO/IEX congu-
ration for all disposal costs. This result is denitive.

7. Discussion

Liquid water at high pressure and temperature was used to
regenerate the adsorption column. This method was chosen over tra-
ditional methods such as solvent extraction or steam regeneration
due to inherent drawbacks in the traditional methods. At large scales
of operation, solvent extraction requires large amounts of solvent
and an additional solvent recovery step which adds to the cost of
the overall process. In many applications the downstream solvent
recovery step (often distillation or a chemical stripping step) is more
expensive than the actual extraction step. This method is only used
when one wants to recover a valuable adsorbate [41].
Steam can be directly used for regeneration. The operation
involves the following steps in sequential order; adsorption, drain,
steam regeneration and purge (condense gas), cool, and rell. The
drain step is to remove the liquid from the interparticle spaces and
the intraparticle pores as this would reduce the amount of steam
needed for regeneration. However, the drain step cannot completely
drain the liquid in the intraparticle pores and is very dicult to
model. Any liquid remaining in the pores after drainage will have
to be evaporated by steam which will require more energy [17,41].
When the exiting vapor is condensed, a hydrocarbon and a contam-
inated water layer that needs to be reprocessed are obtained. Steam
regeneration is typically practiced at 1.0 atm with a 100  C steam
temperature to avoid the decrease in latent heat at higher temper-
atures and pressures. If needed, higher temperatures and pressures
can be employed for desorption of heavy components. The energy
requirements for steam regeneration can be estimated and then be
compared to regeneration with pressurized hot water [15].

When pressurized hot water is used, there is no change of
phase. As latent heat is considerably larger than sensible heat,
EnergyRequirementWater < EnergyRequirementSteam . In light of
these disadvantages, liquid water at high pressure and temperature
was chosen as regenerant.
For this exploratory research, the lack of experimental data
required several assumptions to obtain results. The assumptions are
analyzed and possible areas of improvement are outlined in this
section.
One of the key assumptions is that during the feed and cool-
ing cycles the hydrocarbons are in solution. The hydrocarbons could
also be present as drops in certain cases. Better solubility data,
particularly at high temperatures are needed. If oil occurs in drops,
an extra source term must be included in the model mass balance
equations.
The multicomponent Langmuir isotherm was used to describe
the equilibrium adsorption behavior. Although this isotherm is
commonly used for modeling, few multicomponent systems actu-
ally follow this isotherm and there are additional inherent draw-
backs [42]. The ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) is a better
equilibrium isotherm for multicomponent mixtures [43,44]. How-
ever, IAST requires extensive computing resulting in long simulation
times [45].
Because data are not available, several key assumptions were
made in the regeneration step. Either one assumes that at 160  C the
oil is soluble in water or the following assumptions are required:

 During regeneration oil is not trapped within the pores of acti-
vated carbon and oil droplets do not adhere to the surface of
activated carbon.
 The time of droplet coalescence is much longer than the resi-
dence time in the column.

Even if not all of the oil dissolves, increased solubility makes
the other assumptions more likely. Experimental verication of the
adsorber regeneration step is required. In order to translate this pro-
cess into an operating plant, several lab-scale and pilot plant studies
must be conducted to obtain the following:

 High temperature solubility data.
 Either multicomponent equilibrium data or column adsorption
runs at high temperature and pressure.
 If supersaturation occurs, data on formation/dissolution of
droplets/emulsions during regeneration.
 Data on rate of carbon attrition and poisoning of the carbon
(both must be very low).
 Very good chemical analysis of the waste stream from the
adsorber, so that an appropriate treating system can be identi-
ed.

The possible outcomes for variations in raw produced water
concentration (relative composition) and temperature are listed as
follows:

1. Feed concentration: Depending on the relative amounts of
hydrocarbons in the raw produced water the position of ADS
in the process conguration varies. For the situation when
hydrocarbons are present in negligible quantities such that the
produced water can be directly sent to RO, the ADS either is
not required, or can be used as an intermediate step between
RO cascades, for e.g., PRO-ADS-IEX-SRO.
2. Feed temperature: The ADS can be operated at the same tem-
perature as the discharge from the IGF unit. At higher temper-
atures (>80  C) it must be ensured that the breakthrough time
from the ADS is long enough to process sucient amounts of
feed water in order to make the process self sustaining. The
IEX too can be operated at higher temperatures such that the
temperature of operation is less than the melting temperature
of the polymeric sorbent. However care must be taken that
the feed to the RO is never above 45  C as it can potentially
irreversibly damage the RO membrane.
