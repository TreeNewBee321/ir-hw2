Novel Computer Vision Analysis of Nasal Shape in Children with Unilateral Cleft Lip


abstract

Background: Optimization of treatment of the unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity (uCLND) is hampered 
by lack of objective means to assess initial severity and changes produced by treatment and growth.  
The purpose of this study was to develop automated 3D image analysis specific to the uCLND; assess 
the correlation of these measures to esthetic appraisal; measure changes that occur with treatment 
and differences amongst cleft types. 

Methods: Dorsum Deviation, Tip-Alar Volume Ratio, Alar-Cheek Definition, and Columellar Angle were 
assessed using computer-vision techniques.  Subjects included infants before and after primary cleft lip 
repair (N=50) and children aged 8-10 years with previous cleft lip (N=50).  Two expert surgeons 
ranked subjects according to esthetic nose appearance. 

Results: Computer-based measurements strongly correlated with rankings of infants pre-repair (r=0.8, 
0.75, 0.41 and 0.54  for Dorsum Deviation, Tip-Alar Volume Ratio, Alar-Cheek Definition, and 
Columellar Angle, p<0.01) while all measurements except Alar-Cheek Definition correlated moderately 
with rankings of older children post-repair (r~0.35, p<0.01).  Measurements were worse with greater 
severity of cleft type but improved following initial repair.  Abnormal Dorsum Deviation and 
Columellar Angle persisted after surgery and were more severe with greater cleft type. 

Conclusions: Four fully-automated measures were developed that are clinically relevant, agree with 
expert evaluations and can be followed through initial surgery and in older children. Computer vision 
analysis techniques can quantify the nasal deformity at different stages, offering efficient and 
standardized tools for large studies and data-driven conclusions.

1. Introduction 

Cleft lip with or without palate occurs in 1 in 1000 births and results in complex 3-dimensional 
deformity of the nose (Figure 1).  Although surgery can produce dramatic changes, the lack of objective 
measures and data-driven evaluations of different treatments result in decisions that are based on 
experience instead of scientific evidence. Conventional photography has been used to develop 
objective measures of cleft severity (Mommaerts and Nagy, 2008; Fisher et al., 2008; Fudalej et al., 
2012) however, it suffers from parallax (Oh et al., 2011) and fails to capture the complex 3D nature of 
the deformity. Traditional methods, such as direct anthropometry, CT scan, and dentofacial casts, 
provide richer information but are impractical in clinical settings or for routine use.  

Advances in 3D stereo-photogrammetry, have allowed for acquisition of high-resolution 3D images 
with minimal burden to patients.  Although the technology provides great opportunities to improve 
cleft care, its utility in research and clinical settings is still evolving.  Prior studies have focused on the 
accuracy and reliability of indirect anthropometric analysis (Ort et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Tse et al., 
2014; Othman and Aidil Koay, 2016) and have used this type of analysis to compare children with clefts 
to controls (Hood et al., 2004; Krimmel et al., 2006; Ayoub et al., 2011; Othman et al., 2014), children 
with different types of clefts (Yeow et al., 2002; Bugaighis et al., 2013; Bugaighis et al., 2014a), and 
children before and after surgery (Huempfner-Hierl et al., 2009; Okawachi et al., 2011; Krimmel et al., 
2013; Alazzawi et al., 2017).  Although anthropometric analysis is objective, it does not consider 3D 
shape and the manual landmarking can be tedious.  More recent studies have measured surface 
asymmetry as a standard (Hood et al., 2003; Bilwatsch et al., 2006; Nkenke et al., 2006; Devlin et al., 
2007; Singh et al., 2007; Stauber et al., 2008; Weinberg et al., 2009; Hoefert et al., 2010; Meyer-Marcotty 
et al., 2010; Bugaighis et al., 2013), however, as Fudalej has found, measurement of symmetry alone 
may only have weak association with esthetic rating (Fudalej et al., 2012).  An appropriate objective 
measure may therefore need to be based on specific and clinically relevant features. We define an 
objective measure as one that is not based upon a subjective appraisal and that is based upon 
mathematical measurement following a standardized and well-defined algorithm. 

The goals of this study were to: 

1. Develop automated objective measures of 3D nasal form that are specific and relevant to the 
unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity (uCLND) 
2. Determine the correlation of the measures to subjective appraisals of nose appearance.   
3. Assess changes in measures that occur with primary cleft lip repair 
4. Assess differences in measures amongst children with different types of unilateral cleft lip and 
different age groups 

Our plan is to use the methods and findings of this study to compare treatments and optimize 
outcomes of surgical care.    

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

This study was reviewed and approved by institutional review board of Seattle Children¡¯s Hospital. 
Consent was obtained from all subjects to participate in this project. 

Subjects 

Consecutive families presenting to our institution were recruited for this study.  Group A included 45 
infants with unrepaired cleft lip.  Images before (Infant Pre-repair) and after (Infant Post-repair) 
primary cheiloplasty were collected.  An additional 5 age-matched subjects with no craniofacial 
differences (Infant Control) were included in this group as control.  Infants with clefts in Group A 
underwent repair by the senior author using the Anatomic Subunit Approximation Approach as 
described by Fisher (Fisher, 2005) and modified by Tse (Tse and Lien, 2015). Primary rhinoplasty was 

performed in the form of nasal floor closure, lateral sidewall reconstruction, and primary septoplasty 
(Tse, 2012).   

To assess longer term and a wider variety of outcomes, Group B included 45 children aged 8-10 years 
old who had previously undergone repair (8-10 y Post-repair) and 5 control children aged 8-10 years 
old (8-10 y Control) with no craniofacial differences.   Children with clefts in Group B underwent repair 
by any of 6 surgeons at our institution or by a surgeon at an outside institution.  All had undergone 
variations of rotation-advancement repair (42% repaired at our institution and 58% repaired 
elsewhere).  53% had undergone surgical revision and 73% had undergone alveolar bone grafting.  We 
had no pre-repair images for Group B subjects because 3D image capture was not yet available.   

Imaging and preprocessing 

3D facial images were captured by our center¡¯s professional imaging technologist using the 3dMD 
Cranial System (3dMD, Atlanta, GA). 3D images were preprocessed to extract the face and to correct 
alignment into a standard facial frontal plane using a previously described automated cleaning and 
pose normalization algorithm (Wu et al., 2014). No manual image processing was performed.  The 
images were then analyzed using the developed automated measures.  

Computer-based quantification of cleft severity 

Using a sample set of 3D images and computer vision techniques, we developed automated 
measurements to quantify specific features of the uCLND (Figure 1): dorsal deviation, columellar 
deviation, nasal tip asymmetry, and blunting of the alar-cheek junction (Figure 2A-B).  Columellar 
angle has previously been found to be an important measure of initial cleft severity (Fisher et al., 
2008).  The nasal form and nasal deviation domains of the Asher-McDade scale have previously been 
found to highly correlate with lay-person evaluations of post-operative nasal form via crowdsourcing 
(Tse et al., 2016).  The developed measures were designed to quantify these features.  All of the steps in 
processing and analysis required no manual processing. 

We defined the mid-facial reference plane as the geometric midline that ignores the nasolabial region.  
Based upon a previous study (Wu et al., 2016a), the most valid automated method to produce a 
consistent reference plane was to identify the midline of calculated surface landmarks (Liang et al., 
2013) outside of the nasolabial region (Deformation method). 

To more accurately differentiate dorsum from the tip region of the nose, the profile contour was 
extracted on the sagittal section containing the greatest projecting point of the nose (pronasale).  Using 
local curvature contour analysis, the sellion, pronasale, and subnasale were defined (Figure 3A).  

Horizontal contours were extracted by taking the intersection of the 3D surface mesh with an xz-plane 
at several y-coordinates (Figure 3B-C).  For each contour, the curvature angle was calculated at all 
points by fitting lines to the neighboring 15 points on each side and calculating the angle between two 
lines (Figure 3E). On each contour, four points of interest were identified: two local minima of the 
curvature angle were detected as the nose corners, the global maximum of the curve was detected as 
the nasal dorsum, and the intersection of the contour with the mid-facial plane was identified for 
reference (Figure 3D-E).  In doing so, the borders of the nose could be identified (Figure 3F). 

Dorsum Deviation measures the deviation of the nasal dorsum from the mid-facial reference plane. The 
nasal dorsum was approximated by a line fitted to the highest points (detected through curvature 
analys) at 20 horizontal contours taken from pronasale to sellion. Dorsum Deviation was measured as 
the angle between the dorsum line and the mid-facial reference plane (Figure 2A and 2C).  A perfectly 
symmetrical nose has a Dorsum Deviation of 0¡ã while the Dorsum Deviation increases with 
asymmetry.  

Tip-Alar Volume Ratio measures the volumetric asymmetry of the nasal tip-alar complex. The nasal tip 
was located between the subnasale and alar curvature. Figure 2A illustrates the nasal tip area where 
the Tip-Alar Volume Ratio is calculated. Horizontal contours were extracted, and the area under the 
horizontal contour line was calculated at each plane. Using the automatically calculated mid-facial 
reference plane, the area was divided into two parts (Figure 2D). As an approximation of the nose 
volume, the areas under the left and right sides were summed over all planes. The ratio of the volume 
of the larger side to the smaller side was calculated for each subject. A perfectly symmetrical nose 
produces a ratio of 1, and higher values of Tip-Alar Volume Ratio indicate asymmetry.  

Alar-Cheek Definition measures alar-cheek definition and assesses the contour changes between the 
nasal ala and the cheek with the premise that this distinction tends to be blunted on the cleft side 
(Figure 1B and Figure 2B). 10 horizontal contours from the mid-point between the subnasale and 
pronasale to the alar curvature were extracted. Using the curvature analysis, nose corners were 
detected at each horizontal contour. A line was fitted to the 15 points from the nose corner towards the 
nasal tip and the curvature angle is the angle this line makes with the x-axis. Figure 2E demonstrates 
the curvature angles at two sides. Alar-Cheek Definition was measured as the mean of the absolute 
differences between the angles of the two nose corners. A perfectly symmetrical nose produces an 
Alar-Cheek Definition of 0¡ã, and higher values Alar-Cheek Definition mean greater deformity.   

Columellar Angle measures the deviation and deformation of the columella. Similar to the horizontal 
contours used for the measures above, a set of contours from the midpoint between the pronasale and 
subnasale to the subnasale that are parallel to the xy-plane were extracted. Using curvature analysis, 
the most prominent point on each contour was calculated and the columellar line was approximated 
by the line fitted to these points. Figure 2F demonstrates the points detected by curvature analysis. 
Figure 2B shows the columellar line and the columellar angle computed by the computer, while Figure 
1B shows a columellar line drawn by a cleft surgeon. The Columellar Angle was defined as the angle 
between the columellar line and the yz-plane. A perfectly symmetrical nose has a Columellar Angle of 
0¡ã, and higher values of Columellar Angle mean greater deformity.  

Subjective appraisal of nasal form 

Expert surgeons have previously been found to reliably place images of infants with cleft lip in 
increasing order of nasal severity when allowed to perform side-by-side comparisons (Fisher et al., 
2008).  Images from each group of subjects were assembled and randomly placed onto an electronic 
¡°sorting board¡± (Wu et al., 2016b).  Images could be selected and viewed in a 3D viewer that also 
displayed adjacent images for direct comparison. Pre-repair images of Group A and post-repair images 
of Group B were ranked in order of increasing nasal deformity by expert surgeons (CM and RT, 
respectively).  

To compare rankings with measures, we ordered subjects in each group based on increasing Dorsum 
Deviation, Tip-Alar Volume Ratio, Alar-Cheek Definition and Columellar Angle. The correlation of 
measures to the expert rank order was determined by Pearson¡¯s correlation coefficients of the rank 
orders. 

Changes with primary repair and differences amongst cleft types and extents 

Subjects were grouped by cleft type and cleft extent.  Changes in measures before and after surgery 
and differences in subject groups were assessed using t-test.  

Subject demographics are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.  Group A was consistent with the initial 
presentations normally seen at our institution.  In Group B, there was a preponderance of subjects with 

RESULTS 

complete cleft lip.  Although this is not representative of initial presentations, it is consistent with visits 
in clinic by children at age 8-10 years who are returning for ongoing care.    

Correlation of measures to subjective appraisals of nose deformity 

Correlations of measures to expert ranking of uCLND are summarized in Table 3. In Group A, measures 
of Dorsum Deviation and Tip-Alar Volume Ratio were highly correlated with the expert rankings (0.8 
and 0.75 respectively, p < 0.01) while Alar-Cheek Definition and Columellar Angle produced 
reasonable correlation coefficients (0.41 and 0.54 respectively, p < 0.01).  

The raters did not feel that they could reliably differentiate the nasal appearance of subjects in Group A 
immediately after surgery because all the appearances were similar.  Formal ranking of post-operative 
images of Group A was therefore abandoned.  

The nasal appearances of subjects in Group B were distinct enough that raters could differentiate nasal 
appearance.  The correlation of quantitative measures to the rank order of nasal appearance in Group 
B was moderate for all measures (correlation coefficient of ~0.35, p < 0.01), except for Alar-Cheek 
Definition (correlation coefficient of 0.18, p ~ 0.2).  Apart from Alar-Cheek Definition, all correlations 
were statistically significant (see Table 3).  

Changes with primary cleft lip repair 

All 4 of the nasal measures were significantly reduced after repair and there were greater changes in 
measures with increasing initial severity (Table 4).  

Pre-operative differences amongst cleft type and extent 

In Group A, for all measures, except the Alar-Cheek Definition, the mean values decreased in the order 
of complete, complete with band, incomplete and control (Figure 4). The difference was statistically 
significant between infants with complete cleft and infants with incomplete cleft, and infants with 
complete cleft and controls. Mean Dorsum Deviation for infants with complete cleft was also 
significantly higher than for infants with complete cleft with band.  

When grouped by extent of clefting, measures for infants with CLA and CLP were similar, however, 
measures of nasal deformity decreased for infants with CL and for control subjects.  Those differences 
reached statistical significance for Dorsum Deviation and Tip-Alar Volume Ratio (Figure 5). 

Post-operative differences amongst cleft type and extent 

Following repair, measures of uCLND for children with clefts were worse than for control subjects 
(Table 4).  In Group A the differences reached statistical significance for all measures.  In Group B the 
differences approached significance for Dorsum Deviation (p=0.06) and Columellar Angle (p=0.07). 

When grouped by cleft type, there was a trend toward worsening Columellar Angle with increasing 
cleft severity for both Group A and B.   We also found worsening Dorsum Deviation with worsening 
cleft type in Group B but not in the younger Group A.  Similar trends were not found for the Tip-Alar 
Volume Ratio or the Alar-Cheek Definition.   

Other correlations 

There were no significant differences between amongst ethnicities and the two sexes in any of the 
groups.  

DISCUSSION 

Advances in 3D stereophotogrammetry provide an opportunity for better assessment of cleft 
morphology.   Whereas previous studies used traditional anthropometric analysis as a surrogate for 3D 
form, more recent studies have assessed surface data of 3D images to study facial and regional 
symmetry (Hartmann et al., 2007; Djordjevic et al., 2014).  Dadakova and Bugaighis created average 3D 
images of subjects grouped by cleft type to illustrate differences in morphology and to produce ¡°heat 
maps¡± that demonstrate regional differences in children 3 and 4.5 years (Dad¨¢kov¨¢ et al., 2016) and 8-
12 years old (Bugaighis et al., 2014b) respectively. Schwenzer-Zimmerer used a similar approach to 
visualize changes that occur with initial cleft lip repair performed in Cambodia for patients over 4 
years old (Schwenzer-Zimmerer et al., 2008).  Heat maps have also been used to illustrate changes 
before and after both secondary alveolar bone grafting (Kau et al., 2011) and secondary rhinoplasty 
(Nakamura et al., 2011).  Although these methods nicely illustrate differences and changes, they are 
qualitative, rely upon manually placed landmarks, and do not specifically address differences or 
changes of the nose.   

Geometric morphometrics have been applied to assess 3D images. Bugaighis used Procrustes analysis 
and principal component analyses to assess differences amongst averaged faces for subjects grouped 
by cleft type at 8-12 years of age (Bugaighis et al., 2010) and Bell used Procrustes analysis and facial 
curve analysis to compare regions of asymmetry amongst subjects grouped by cleft type at 10 years of 
age (Bell et al., 2014).  They found that different facial regions exhibited different degrees of 
asymmetry.  Kuijpers examined a similar group of subjects using manual landmarks, mirror images 
and surface based registration and found that the nose was the most asymmetric region of the face 
(Kuijpers et al., 2015).  Their findings are consistent with the clinical notion that persistent nasal 
deformity is common and correction of the uCLND remains a significant challenge.   

Only a few studies focus specifically on the nose. Singh used landmark-based geometric 
morphometrics to look at 3D nasal changes from nasoalveolar molding (Singh et al., 2005). van Loon 
performed linear measurements and volumetric analysis of nasal symmetry in a group of 3 year-old 
children to demonstrate differences between children with repaired clefts and volunteers without 
clefts (van Loon et al., 2011).  In a similar manner, both Linden and van Loon manually isolated noses 
on 3D images and quantified overall symmetry for two methods of primary rhinoplasty (Linden et al., 
2016) and before and after secondary rhinoplasty (van Loon et al., 2010), respectively.  None of these 
studies have assessed infants before and after surgery and none of these examined specific features of 
the uCLND.  Although overall symmetry may be an objective measure of form, as Fudalej has found, 
asymmetry alone may only partially account for esthetic ratings of form (Fudalej et al., 2012; Desmedt 
et al., 2015).  In order to improve results of treatment, specific and clinically relevant measures of the 
uCLND nasal are required.   

Our study differs from prior work in a number of ways.  First, we developed measures based upon 
clinically relevant features of the uCLND that surgeons and lay people use to assess cleft severity and 
treatment outcome (Fisher et al., 2008; Meltzer et al., 2013; Tse et al., 2016).  Second, we assessed the 
correlation of these measures to esthetic appraisals of the unilateral cleft lip deformity and found 
strong agreement, thereby validating use of the measures for clinical and research purposes.  Third, as 
opposed to evaluating a single age group, we examined subjects at 3 time points (pre-lip repair, post-
lip repair, and at 8-10 years of age).  Although the subjects in Group A and B were different, the same 
analysis may be used in the future for true longitudinal assessment. Finally, we used completely 
automated processes from image cleaning, registration and pose normalization (Wu et al., 2014) to 
shape analysis.  In contrast, previous methods require manual cropping or landmarks.  By minimizing 
the burden of work on investigators, we hope to enable more centers to analyze and study their 
outcomes.  Automation allows for study of large volumes of images in an efficient and practical 
manner.  While these tools have considerable value in facilitating research, objective 3D analysis has 
also been found to be of clinical value for surgeons in planning and decision-making(Trotman et al., 

2013).  Trotman et al. found that pre-operative systematic image analysis frequently resulted in 
alterations of surgical goals. 

We found progressively worse measures of uCLND for worsening cleft types.  Cleft lip repair and 
primary nasal correction improved all measures.  Although we may have found similar relationships of 
appearance, cleft type, and changes with surgery using surgeon assessments, those assessments are 
tedious and time consuming.  In addition, overall subjective appraisals by surgeons do not provide 
feedback on specific features that may contribute to an overall appearance.   For infants post-repair, 
the Tip-Alar Volume Ratio and Alar-Cheek Definition were similar to that of controls, however Dorsum 
Deviation and Columellar Angle remained greater than that of controls.  Similarly, for older children, 
the Tip-Alar Ratio was similar to that of control subjects, whereas the more specific measures of 
uCLND, Dorsum Deviation, Alar-Cheek Definition, and Columellar Angle, were greater for subjects with 
greater cleft severity.  There may be several reasons why the Alar-Cheek Definition was worse in the 
older group than in the infant systepost-repair group including, recurrent deformity, differences in 
surgical technique, and a preponderance of subjects with complete clefts in the older group.  Given that 
Group A underwent surgery by a single surgeon using one technique and that Group B underwent 
surgery by multiple surgeons using different techniques, inferences from direct comparison of the two 
groups is limited.. As we follow subjects in Group A over time with repeated images, analysis and true 
longitudinal assessment, we will gain further insights.  For now, our results suggest that the treatment 
approaches in Group A and Group B leave residual dorsal deviation and columellar angulation but 
correct volumetric asymmetry of the nasal tip-alar region.  Insights from these specific measures have 
potential value for both outcomes research and clinical feedback.  

Although specific measures of the uCLND offer new opportunities, several features remain a challenge.   
We were unable to develop an automated method to measure nostril size and shape.  While those can 
be measured manually (Stauber et al., 2008), the sparse mesh resolution in the nasal cavity results in 
inaccurate representation of form, data holes, and artifacts that prevent accurate automated detection. 
With improvements in imaging of these regions, we may be able to more accurately detect and 
measure nostril shapes.  We were also unable to detect the two pronasale landmarks that an expert 
may recognize as part of the uCLND.  Computer vision still lacks the complex human perception of 
form and can¡¯t detect these by computation.  We therefore defined a single pronasale point based 
mathematically as the greatest projecting point along the z-axis.   

Our future plans include producing a user-friendly interface that would allow clinicians and non-
computer science researchers to use the developed tools for automated image cleaning, normalization, 
and analysis.  Ultimately we plan to use similar analysis to study nasal morphology following primary 
septoplasty, tip rhinoplasty, secondary tip rhinoplasty, and secondary septorhinoplasty.  We may not 
be able to fully correct the uCLND in a single stage, however we may be able to optimize care by 
producing stepwise improvements that minimize the number of procedures a patient undergoes.  
Quantitative methods of measurement are necessary to assess changes in the setting of varying initial 
cleft severity, multi-stage treatment, and changes or relapse that occur with time and growth. 

CONCLUSION 

We have developed four specific and objective measures of the uCLND that can be generated by 
automated computer analysis.  Those measures had tight correlation with expert assessments of initial 
cleft severity and moderate correlation with expert assessments of treatment outcome.   

In our study population, we found that primary cleft lip repair resulted in improved nasal form as 
determined by the objective measures, however, residual Dorsum Deviation and Columellar 
Angulation persisted.   Similar residual deformities of Dorsum Deviation and Columellar Angulation 
were found in an older population of children age 8-10 years of age who previously underwent 
treatment.  Further work is needed to specifically measure other residual features of the uCLND and to 
determine the best strategies for treatment over the course of longitudinal care. 

3D stereo-photogrammetry provides a unique opportunity to develop automated and specific 
measures that can facilitate large-scale analysis and minimize barriers to outcomes assessment.  In 
turn, the objective data may be used to directly or indirectly improve patient care.

Figure 1 A patient with cleft lip nasal deformity: A. Asymmetry and deviation of nasal tip and 
dorsum relative to midline B. Deviation of columella and blunting of nasal ala-cheek junction on the 
cleft side on the cleft side.  

Figure 2 Shape analysis based measurements: A. Frontal view of a 3D mesh. Dorsal Deviation is 
defined as the angle between the dorsal line (red) and mid-facial reference plane (blue), whereas Tip-
Alar Volume Ratio is the ratio of volumes of the two halves of the nose divided by the mid-facial 
reference plane, indicated by green and red shades. B. Basal view of a 3D mesh. Alar-Cheek Definition 
is defined as the difference between angles (green) at the two sides of the nose, and Columellar 
Deviation is the angle columella (red) makes with the yz-plane. C. The highest points of the nose at the 
contours taken between pronasale and sellion were used to fit the dorsal line. D. The area under each 
horizontal contour was divided into two by using the mid-facial reference plane (blue dot). The sum of 
these areas on all contours approximated the nose volume, and the ratio of the larger sum to the 
smaller sum was calculated as Tip-Alar Volume Ratio. E. Curvature angles were calculated at two nose 
corners by fitting lines (green) to the neighboring points towards nose tip. F. The most prominent 
points on contours between the subsanale and the midpoint between the subnasale and pronasale 
were used to fit the columellar line. 

Figure 3 Horizontal contours and curvature analysis: A. The profile contour is used to detect 
subnasale (sn), pronasale (pn) and sellion (se). B. The horizontal contours from a frontal view. C. 
Horizontal contours from a basal view. D. Several points of interest including nose corners (green), 
nose tip (red) and mid-facial reference plane were noted on a horizontal contour.  E. Plot of curvature 
angle at each point in horizontal contour in D. The highest point of the nose (red) and two corners of 
the nose where nasal ala meets the cheek (green) were detected through curvature analysis. F. Nose 
corners reflected on the 3D surface for visualization. They follow the crease of the nose. 

Figure 4 Mean values of severity measures by cleft type: For Infants Pre-repair, all measurements 
followed a decreasing trend with less severe cleft types.  The differences reached significance for 
complete clefts and variably for complete clefts with band and incomplete clefts.  There were more 
significant differences amongst groups for Dorsum Deviation and Tip-Alar Volume Ratio.  All measures 
improved after surgery and were similar amongst groups except for persistent trends of worse 
Columellar Angle for more severe cleft types in both the Infant Post-Repair and the 8-10 year old 
group.    The Alar-Cheek definition was similar amongst groups for Infants post-repair but seemed to 
follow a trend of worse measures with more severe clefts for children in the older group.
