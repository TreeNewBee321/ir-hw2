abstract
The present paper comprises of an integrated system in which industrial heating, space cooling, electrical power
and fresh water are produced by multigeneration system using solar, geothermal and ocean thermal energy in-
puts. Fresh water is produced using a multi stage ash desalination (MSF), and the direct steam generator (DSG)
is used to produce power from solar. The geothermal system, with double stage ashing, is incorporated to assist
solar due to its intermittent nature. The ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is interconnected with desali-
nation system while producing 30.49 kW with 0.73% energy efciency. The proposed system is analyzed energet-
ically and exegetically, and it is found that the energy and exergy efciencies of the overall system are 13.93% and
17.97% respectively.

1. Introduction

Our planet has been facing pollution problems due to excessive use
of fossil fuels. Power generation and transportation applications have
been contributing to make our environment worse. That is why the
need for clean and renewable energies has signicantly increased. The
main source of renewable energy for this planet is sun. Almost
170,000 TW of solar radiation falls on the Earth each year [1]. This ener-
gy from the sun is stored in earth's crust which is known as geothermal
energy. Ninety nine percent of earth's volume has temperature more
than 1000 ∼C [2]. Similarly, this energy from sun is collected by sea
water. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems are devel-
oped to harvest this energy to convert it into useful work.
Fossil fuel degradation, pollution issues and increasing oil prices are
diverting attention towards renewable energy resources. Many studies
are conducted on the combination of renewable resources to eliminate
fossil fuel consumption. Solar energy is not enough for power produc-
tion throughout a day. That is why more sources are merged to over-
come this problem. The previous studies show production of multiple
outputs from one system improves overall efciency of plant [3每7].
Ozturk and Dincer [3] studied a system in which power, heat, hot
water, cooling and hydrogen are produced using energy input. They
combined organic Rankine, Rankine, absorption and hydrogen cycles
in one system. Their obtained exergy efciency was higher than the
sub-systems efciencies. Sinan and Dincer [4] proposed multigeneration
system to produce hydrogen, electricity, heating and cooling using wind
and solar energy inputs. They found that the overall efciency of the sys-
tem was higher than the individual systems. Khalid et al. [5] studied a
multigeneration system with two renewable energy resources to pro-
duce multiple outputs. The calculated energy and exergy efciencies
for overall system were found higher than the efciencies of biomass
and solar systems. Suleman et al. [6] investigated a multigeneration sys-
tem with solar and geothermal energy inputs to produce multiple out-
puts. Their study showed the advantage of using multigeneration
system over single separate energy systems. Yang et al. [7] combined
ground source heat pump with fuel cell and determined that less energy
consumption by hybrid system than ground source system. This shows
that multigeneration systems are advantageous and gaining popularity
throughout the world [8每9].
On the basis of above studies, a system is proposed with renewable
resources to produce fresh water, electricity, industrial heating and
space cooling. Geothermal and OTEC systems are added to assist solar
energy input. No heat transfer uid (HTF) is used in solar collectors as
direct steam generation (DSG) has higher cycle temperature and ther-
mal efciency than indirect steam generation systems [10]. Addition
of HTF will make cycle more complicated, and the efciency will drop
down. DSG plants produce 11% cheaper electricity than conventional
oil heating systems [11]. To enhance power input, geothermal double
ash system is incorporated in the system. Double ash geothermal
can generate 20每25% more power than single ash cycle [12每14].
Around 25% of world's geothermal energy systems are based on double
ash system [15].
Production of fresh water by desalinating sea water is adopted by
several countries specically in countries which have water shortage.
Almost 80 countries in the world face the scarcity of fresh water [13].
Note that worldwide 27% desalination plants are thermally driven
[16]. MSF plant operates at relatively lower temperature (under
100 ∼C) [17]. Multi-Stage ash desalination system consists of several
stages. In each following stage, pressure is kept lower than the previous
stage to ash the steam. In this paper MSF with three stages are selected.
It is running with the combination of both solar and geothermal energy.
OTEC is a technique to harvest tidal heat energy. It is basically the
temperature difference in water column of sea at different depths
which could be up to 5 ∼C, [18] and standard depth difference is usually
1000 m [19]. The idea of OTEC, to generate electricity, was rst proposed
by D'Arsenoval in 1881 [20] and this concept is sometimes considered
as virtually free of environmental impacts [21]. Vapor absorption cycle
is interconnected with MSF plant to produce air conditioning. Coef-
cient of performance for single effect absorption cycle typically varies
from 0.7 to 1.2 for refrigeration temperatures above 0 ∼C [22].
The specic objective of this study is to design and analyze thermo-
dynamically of a new multigeneration system with solar, geothermal
and OTEC energy inputs to produce fresh water, electricity, industrial
heating and space cooling; and to study the effects of varying operating
conditions and system parameters on the overall system performance.
The calculations of energy and exergy efciencies of the present
multigeneration system and its subsystems are included in this study.

2. System description and assumptions

Solar, geothermal and OTEC sources are utilized as energy inputs
while electricity, fresh water, industrial heating and space cooling are
produced as the useful outputs. This system is a combination of steam
turbines, pumps, generator, condenser, heat exchangers, solar collec-
tors, mixing chamber, desalination plant, expansion valves, steam sepa-
rator and cooling tower. Schematic diagram of the said system is
presented in Fig. 1. All components work simultaneously to produce de-
sired outputs using clean energy resources. The sea water entering the
OTEC system is utilized in desalination plant, saving extra pump work
to extract water for desalination plant. The steam injected by low pres-
sure turbine is driving MSF plant and remaining heat is utilized by vapor
absorption cycle. As this steam is the sum, of both geothermal and solar
system uids, it splits into two sections after condenser. The extra con-
densate is drained back to geothermal well while remaining liquid is
sent back to solar eld to regain energy from sun. The geothermal sys-
tem is extracting saturated water at high temperature and pressure,
which is being converted into steam by ashing it twice in separators
A and B. The unconverted liquid drains back to the well. Following as-
sumptions are made in analyzing the system

 The ambient temperature and pressure are assumed to be To = 25 ∼C
and pressure Po = 1 bar.
 The OTEC cycle has ammonia as the working uid.
 The salinity of sea water for desalination plant is taken = 48,000 ppm.
 All processes are in steady state with negligible potential and kinetic
energy.
 The multi-stage desalinations has three stages.
 The salt, water and saline water are incompressible substances.
 The temperature of sun is assumed to be 6000 K.

3. Thermodynamic modelling

The proposed system is analyzed both energetically and
exergetically by assuming appropriate temperatures and pressures at
all state points. The exergy balance equations of each component are
written to nd exergy destructions. Similarly efciencies of each system,
OTEC, geothermal, MSF, are calculated separately based on proposed
data. Both energetic and exergetic COPs for vapor absorption cycle are
determined. In the end, the overall system is assessed, and the study
graphs are plotted to analyze the variation of certain parameters with
respect to others. The calculations, by assuming appropriate tempera-
ture pressures at all state points, are made using Engineering Equation
Solver (EES). Energy efciencies are dened as the ratio of useful energy
output to energy input [3]. The energy input from the sun is calculated
as

4. Results and discussion

The specic enthalpy, entropy and exergy at each point are calculat-
ed as tabulated in Table 2, while the owrates are set by iteration to get
optimum performance. Fig. 2 shows exergy destructions of main com-
ponents of the proposed system. The highest exergy destruction is
found in concentrated solar collectors which is much higher than any
other component. Turbine B and mixing chamber has second and
third highest exergy destructions. Special attention needs to be paid in
reducing the exergy destruction rate for solar collectors to improve
overall efciency of the system. Table 3 summarizes all the results gen-
erated from calculation work including cooling and heating loads, ener-
gy and exergy efciencies of each system, overall energy and exergy
efciency, power outputs, collector area, solar irradiation and COPs of
absorption cycle.
Fig. 3 shows the effects of exit temperature (T1) from DSG on solar
cycle efciencies and overall system efciencies. Being the main work-
ing uid for the whole system, energy and exergy efciencies are in-
creasing with the increase in temperature. But to get higher
temperature and more energy input, area of collector needs to be ex-
panded. Higher temperature and high energy content will increase

power production. On the other hand, if HTF is introduced, then heat ex-
changer addition will cause heat energy to lose causing drop in overall
efciency.
Fig. 4 shows the relation of solar irradiation on the solar and overall
efciencies. No effect is been observed on solar cycle, energy and exergy
efciencies, by varying solar irradiation, from 400 W/m2 to 800 W/m2,
while there is slight increase in overall energy efciency i.e. from
13.3% to 14.3%. The reason of no effect, on solar efciencies, is the direct
link of power output of turbine A with incoming uid, means higher the
solar radiations higher will be the power output. Hence, solar efcien-
cies will remain unaffected by irradiations while overall efciencies
will ramp up. Irradiation will increase power output, but in comparison
to overall system, its effect is minimal.
Fig. 5 is illustrated based on the study of relation between mass
owrate extracted from geothermal well on geothermal cycle and over-
all cycle efciency. Both efciencies are dropping down by the incre-
ment of owrate ( _m8 ) from 250 kg/s to 350 kg/s. The overall
efciency is dropping from 6.47% to 5.56%. Note that it makes no
sense to pull more uid as it will depict inverse effect on the whole sys-
tem. The quality of saturated water from well is not sufcient to surge
efciency. More than half of the incoming uid, that does not ash
into steam, goes back to the well without being used in any process.
So increase in _m8 will reduce _m1 causing overall as well as geothermal
efciency to drop.
Similarly, the output temperature of the geothermal well, T8, has ex-
actly the same effect as of _m8 . Even trends in Fig. 6 look much similar to
Fig. 5. Thus, the reason is obviously the same for temperature as well.
The steam from solar cycle is being injected into geothermal mixing
chamber. If mass _m1 increases then ultimately owrate from geothermal
well has to be decreased in order to manage the owrate entering tur-
bine B which will cause drop in geothermal efciency.
The energy and exergy efciencies of desalination plant have direct
relation with mass owrate coming in from the sea. Fig. 7 shows straight

direct relation on _m42. Increasing owrate from 200 kg/s to 300 kg/s, en-
ergy efciency is ramping up from 51.58% to 77.36%. But the point is, en-
ergy input should also be increased correspondingly to manage the
same effect on efciency. Otherwise it looks obvious, more sea water
input, more will be the product of fresh water. In order to maintain
MSF plant efciency, both owrates _m1 and _m42 needs to be increased
proportionally to produce more or less fresh water output. Altering
both owrates is not easy at once, as other subsystems may drastically
be affected by this change. MSF plant is connected with OTEC cycle in
a way that incoming water is providing heat to the boiler of OTEC sys-
tem. Means only one pump is enough for both the system, saving
extra pump work for OTEC cycle.
The energetic and exergetic COPs have direct relation with temper-
ature of saturated water exiting from generator of absorption cycle.
Fig. 8 shows clear illustration of the said statement, means higher the
exit temperature (T21), higher will be the COP. The variation of energetic
COP is observed changing from 0.03499 to 0.03647 while increasing the
temperature from 75 ∼C to 85 ∼C. It all depends on the energy content
available in the incoming uid. If the uid entering generator has higher
temperature, it should then be released at higher temperature while
transferring energy to absorption cycle. The overall exergy efciency
will remain unchanged by varying temperature T21.

Fig. 4. Effect of solar irradiation on energy and exergy efciencies of solar system and

Fig. 6. Effect of temperature (T8) on energy and exergy efciencies of geothermal system
and overall system.

The effect of ambient temperature is analyzed both on overall ener-
gy and exergy efciencies. Fig. 9 shows exergy efciency is directly pro-
portional to ambient temperature. Changing ambient temperature from
15 ∼C to 25 ∼C the exergy efciency increases from 17.66% to 17.97%. This
rise in exergy efciency is minimal or may be negligible to observe the
effect of varying ambient temperature on the overall system perfor-
mance. Energy efciency has no effect of ambient temperature. This
cycle can be operated in normal environmental temperature of 15 ∼C
to 25 ∼C with no effect in efciency.
Numerous studies have already been conducted on multigeneration
systems for thermodynamic assessment. This design appears to be dif-
ferent from others in a sense that OTEC is introduced with other renew-
able systems. Although its performance becomes low, it still offers a
good opportunity for improvement and hence better performance.

fresh water by MSF distillation plant with 51.58% energy efciency,
and providing industrial heating up to 39.48 MW. Similarly, energetic
COP is found to be 0.03674. OTEC is producing 30.49 kW with efciency
of 0.73%. Furthermore it is found that the overall energy and exergy ef-
ciencies of the system are 13.93% and 17.97% respectively.

A new multigeneration system with solar, geothermal and OTEC en-
ergy inputs, to produce electricity, industrial heating, space cooling and
fresh water, is designed and assessed using energy and exergy analyses
and efciency assessments. The exergy destructions of major compo-
nents are calculated. The solar collector has the highest exergy destruc-
tion of 287.62 MW while desalination HX and turbine-2 are two other
components with high exergy destruction. Thus, the efforts need to be
made to minimize these exergy destructions for the better performance
of the system. The area of solar collector required is found to be 909,261
m2 while the total power output is almost 55 MW. Geothermal and solar
options are the main sources of energy, which produce 18.54 kg/s of
