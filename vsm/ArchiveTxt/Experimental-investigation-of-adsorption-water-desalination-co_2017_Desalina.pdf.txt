abstract

Although many adsorbent materials have been used in adsorption systems, only silica-gel was tested experimen-
tally for desalination applications. This work experimentally and numerically investigates the use of CPO-27(Ni)
an advanced Metal Organic Framework-MOF adsorbent material in a 1-bed adsorption system for water desali-
nation and cooling applications. Operating parameters as switching time, half cycle time, evaporator and con-
denser water inlet temperatures were studied to investigate their effects on cycle water production and
cooling. Moreover, a mathematical simulation model is developed, validated and used to predict cycle outputs
at other operating conditions. Results showed that as evaporator temperature increases and condenser temper-
ature decreases, cycle outputs increase. Also, it was shown that adsorption desalination cycles can work with con-
denser pressure lower than evaporator pressure as the cycle is an open loop one (i.e. no refrigerant is owing
back from condenser to evaporator). A water production of 22.8 m3/tonne﹞ads/day was achieved using 40 ∼C
evaporator temperature, 5 ∼C condenser temperature and 95 ∼C desorption temperature. Similar water produc-
tion can be achieved using 30 ∼C condensing temperature but at 120 ∼C desorption temperature. For space cooling
applications (Tevap b 20 ∼C), cycle cooling produced was found to be 65 Rton/tonne﹞ads. This work highlights the
potential of using advanced MOF materials for water desalination/ cooling applications.

1. Introduction

Many countries depend on water desalination technologies to meet
their potable water needs. Four water desalinating techniques are wide-
ly used which are reverse osmosis (RO), multistage ash (MSF), multi-
effect distillation (MED) and mechanical vapor compression (MVC)
[1]. However, these techniques suffer from high power consumption
which in turn increases CO2 emissions and water production costs
[2,3]. Recently adsorption desalination technology was reported to out-
perform the current conventional technologies in terms of high grade
fresh potable water of salinity as low as 10 ppm, lower electric energy
consumption of 1.38 kWh/m3 and CO2 emission of 0.6 kg/m3 while hav-
ing lower water production cost of 0.2$/m3 [4].
The adsorption water desalination cycle consists of three main com-
ponents namely adsorption/desorption bed, evaporator and condenser
producing desalinated water (from condenser) and cooling (from evap-
orator) [5每9]. The desalination/refrigeration adsorption system de-
pends on the combination of four processes; evaporation due to
adsorption and condensation as a result of desorption. Seawater is fed
into the evaporator where it is evaporated as a result of the associated
adsorption process while extracting heat from the chilled water passing
through the evaporator coil producing the cooling effect in this cycle [6,
10]. In the adsorption process, water vapor is adsorbed by the adsorbent
material while in the desorption process the water vapor is regenerated
by heating and the desorbed water vapor is then condensed in the con-
denser producing fresh water [11,12].
Different adsorbent materials including silica-gel and zeolite have
been reported for desalination applications using different cycle cong-
urations. Thu et al.

desalination system operates in two and four bed modes. Heating
source temperature and cycle time have been examined during their
tests for the two operating modes. It was found that as heat source tem-
perature decreases, longer cycle time is required to obtain the highest
water production. In addition, in two bed mode, maximum water pro-
duction reported was 8.7 m3/tonne of silica-gel/day when 85 ∼C hot
source temperature was used while for four bed mode, at the same
heating temperature, 10 m3/tonne of silica-gel/day was produced.
Ng et al. [8], have used a 215 m2 solar collector to obtain the required
heating for regeneration of water vapor in a 2 bed silica-gel adsorption
system for water desalination and cooling applications. The solar collec-
tor produced heat source temperature varying from 65 to 80 ∼C which
used to produce 3每5 m3 of desalinated water and cooling in the range
of 25每35 Rton/tonne of silica-gel at chilled water temperature of 7 to
10 ∼C.
Mitra et al. [14], have introduced a new adsorption cycle for desali-
nation and cooling. This system has 2 stages with 2 beds per stage. Sim-
ulations as well as experiments have been carried out at different
evaporator pressures and half cycle times to predict desalinated water
output, cooling capacity and coefcient of performance (COP). Results
showed that maximum produced desalinated water is 1 m3/tonne sili-
ca-gel/day while cooling capacity is 7.5 Rton/tonne silica-gel with COP
value of 0.25. These results were obtained at evaporator pressure of
1.7 kPa and half cycle time of 1800 s. The authors attributed these low
production capacities, compared to literature, to the quite high ambient

temperature, 41 ∼C, which affected the performance of the air cooled
condenser. In addition, 2每3 times larger silica gel particle sizes than
those reported in literature were used which resulted in slower adsorp-
tion/desorption rates.
Youssef et al. [15], have studied the use of advanced zeolite material,
AQSOA-Z02, for adsorption desalination and cooling applications. In
their work, a comparison between the AQSOA-ZO2 and silica-gel has
been performed when operating in a two bed adsorption cycle for the
production of desalinated water and cooling. The key parameters of
the comparison are SDWP and specic cooling power (SCP) while dif-
ferent heating source temperatures and evaporator water inlet temper-
atures were applied. It was found that AQSOA-Z02 is less sensitive than
silica gel to evaporator water temperature variations. Accordingly,
AQSOA-Z02 outperformed silica-gel at lower evaporator water temper-
atures b 25 ∼C where at 10 ∼C evaporator water temperature, AQSOA-
Z02 cycle can produce 5.8 m3 water per day and 50.1 Rton of cooling
while silica-gel cycle generate only SDWP of 2.8 m3 and SCP of
17.2 Rton. On the other hand, at the same heating temperature of
85 ∼C but at 30 ∼C evaporator water temperature silica-gel cycle pro-
duces maximum SDWP of 8.4 m3 and 62.4 Rton of cooling.
Youssef et al. [16], have investigated the use of AQSOA-Z02 in a novel
adsorption system consisting of evaporator, condenser, integrated
evaporator-condenser device and 4 adsorber beds. Results showed
that by utilizing heat recovery between system components, water pro-
duction can reach 12.4 m3/tonne adsorbent/day and cooling of
32.4 Rton/tonne adsorbent at evaporator inlet water temperature of
10 ∼C. Also, results showed that this system can produce 15.4 m3/
tonne adsorbent/day of desalinated water if no cooling is required.
Ali et al. [17], have presented a double stage system to produce
cooling through stage-1 and desalinated water from condensers of
stages 1 and 2. AQSOA-Z02 and silica-gel were used as adsorbents in
the two stages, 1 and 2 respectively. A heat recovery was implemented
between condensers and evaporators of the system to reduce condenser
pressure and increase evaporator pressure which resulted in increased
cycle outputs. Results showed that this new conguration produced
more water by 26% and 45% more cooling compared to the conventional
adsorption desalination and cooling systems.
Elsayed et al. [18] have investigated numerically the potential of
using two metal organic framework adsorbent materials (MOF) for dif-
ferent adsorption applications including water desalination and cooling.
Isotherms, kinetics and cycle stability were measured for both CPO-
27(Ni) and Aluminum fumarate MOF materials where the maximum
uptake was 0.47 and 0.53 kgwater/kgadsorbent respectively. It was found
that at high desorption temperatures (N 90 ∼C) and low evaporation
temperature (5 ∼C), CPO-27(Ni) outperforms Al-Fumarate. However,
Al-Fumarate resulted in better performance at high evaporation tem-
perature of 20 ∼C and/or low bed heating temperature of 70 ∼C.
All reviewed work on water adsorption desalination, showed that
silica-gel/water is the only working pairs investigated experimentally.
This work, experimentally investigates the use of an advanced metal or-
ganic frameworks adsorbent material, (CPO-27Ni, produced by Johnson
Matthey Ltd.) in a 1 bed adsorption cycle for production of fresh water
and cooling. In addition, a numerical simulation is carried out, validated
and used to predict the system performance at other operating
conditions.

adsorption time, cooling water is circulated in the adsorption bed to ab-
sorb the released heat from the adsorbent material. Then, in the desorp-
tion phase, the bed is heated by hot water and water vapor is
regenerated. During this desorption process, the adsorber bed is con-
nected to the condenser where the water vapor is condensed producing
fresh water. As shown in Fig. 2, there are other auxiliary components in
the system which are heating and cooling water systems for the bed and
temperature controllers to supply constant water temperatures for the
evaporator and condenser. In addition, there are vacuum pumps to gen-
erate the required vacuum pressure in the system. Adsorber bed as
shown in Fig. 3 is a rectangular nned tube heat exchanger with the ad-
sorbent material packed between the ns and surrounded by a metal
mesh to keep adsorbent particles in position. The evaporator and con-
denser are cylindrical vacuum designed chambers with helically shaped
cooling coil.
The experimental test facility is equipped with TJC100-CPSS T-type
thermocouples to measure the temperature of the evaporator liquid
and gas, adsorbent material in bed and vapor in the bed space. In the
condenser, RS-pro, K-type thermocouples are used for measuring
vapor and condensed water temperatures. Platinum RTD temperature
sensors were used to measure bed heating and cooling water inlet and
outlet temperatures, evaporator and condenser circulating water inlet
and outlet temperatures. The evaporator, condenser and adsorber bed

pressures are measured using pressure transducers with an accuracy
of ㊣ 0.01 kPa. Flowmeters of type FLC-H14 (0每57 LPM) are used to mea-
sure the adsorber bed heating/cooling water owrate manually with an
accuracy of ㊣ 1 L while owrates of condenser and evaporator water
circuits are measured by Parker type owmeter (2每30 LPM) with an ac-
curacy of ㊣ 5%. Details of the system component specications are pre-
sented in Table 1.

carried out at university of Birmingham, UK to determine the relation
between uptake and time. By tting the test results, the obtained con-
stants of the LDF model are presented in Table 4 [23].
For assessment of adsorption desalination/cooling cycle perfor-
mance, two parameters are calculated which are Specic Daily Water
Production (SDWP) and Specic Cooling Power (SCP). SDWP is the
amount of water produced per tonne of adsorbent per day while SCP
is the amount of produced cooling per unit mass of adsorbent material
used. These parameters are calculated using Eqs. 5每8 [6]:

CPO-27Ni used in this work is an MOF adsorbent manufactured
commercially by Johnson Matthey. Fig. 4 shows SEM image for this ad-
sorbent material and its physical properties are listed in Table 2 [19每21].
For prediction of adsorbent material performance, two parameters
are required namely adsorption isotherms and kinetics. The maximum
amount of adsorbate that can be adsorbed per unit mass of dry material
at a certain pressure ratio is called ＆adsorption isotherms＊ while the rate
of adsorption or desorption at the operating pressure ratio is called ＆ad-
sorption kinetics＊. The pressure ratio is dened as the ratio between
evaporator to bed pressures during adsorption process or ratio between
condenser to bed pressure during desorption process. CPO-27Ni iso-
therms are modelled using Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) model (Eqs. 1 &
2) [22] with the constants given in Table 3 [23].

4. Results and discussion

As discussed in Section 3, adsorbent material performance depends
on the partial pressure ratio determined by the adsorber bed and heat
exchanger temperatures. For the material to work at low partial pres-
sure ratio during desorption time (P(Tcond)/P(Tdes)), this can be achieved
either by increasing the heating uid temperature or decreasing the
condenser cooling water temperature. The operating temperature con-
ditions used in this paper were selected to achieve partial pressure ra-
tios ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 corresponding to condensing
temperature ranging from 5 ∼C to 30 ∼C at xed desorption temperature
of 95 ∼C while adsorber bed cooling water is supplied from the mains at
average temperature of 15 ∼C. Flowrates of water circuits in evaporator,
condenser and adsorber beds are 4, 5 and 7.25 L/min respectively. Also,
this work investigates the effect of other parameters like switching
time, cycle time, evaporator water temperature and condenser water
temperature on water production and cooling capacity.

4.1. Switching time effect

Switching time is the period of time when adsorbent bed is not con-
nected neither to the evaporator nor to the condenser. During this time,
adsorbent bed is either in precooling or in preheating process to be pre-
pared for adsorption or desorption processes respectively. In this test,
ve switching times are tested from 5 to 1 min. at constant half cycle
time of 14 min. Heating and cooling water temperatures are 95 ∼C and
16 ∼C while evaporator and condenser water temperatures are 10 ∼C.
Fig. 5, shows the adsorber bed temperature through 5 consecutive cy-
cles with switching time decreasing by 1 min every cycle. It can be
seen that as switching time decreases, bed temperature prole becomes
more smooth (as indicated by the two circles) leading to reducing the
energy demand for heating and cooling the bed. Therefore the one-min-
ute switching time was selected to be the best switching time for all fur-
ther investigations.

4.2. Half cycle time effect

Half cycle time is the time for adsorption or desorption processes
during the cycle when the bed is either connected to the evaporator
or to the condenser. In this test six half cycle times were investigated
ranging from 8 to18 min and their results are shown in Figs. 6 & 7.

Fig. 6 shows that as the half cycle time increases, the amount of water
collected per cycle is increasing. However, by increasing cycle duration,
number of cycles per day will decrease which adversely affects the daily
water production. Results showed that half cycle time of 12 min can pro-
duce the maximum amount of daily water production of 6.8 m3/
tonne﹞ads/day. Regarding cooling output, Fig. 7 shows that as cycle time
increases SCP decreases. This could be attributed to the evaporator tem-
perature prole as it decreases at a higher rate at the beginning than at
the end of the adsorption time which results in lower average evaporator
temperature at shorter cycle times which in turn increases SCP. Although
half cycle time of 10 min gives the highest SCP of 200 W/kg (57 Rton/
tonne﹞ads), a time of 12 min is used for the rest of the experimental
work since it results in maximum SDWP which is the main focus of this
research.

4.3. Evaporator and condenser water temperature effect

Water desalination adsorption cycle is an open loop system which is
characterized by seawater feed in the evaporator and desalinated fresh
water extraction from the condenser. Accordingly, this cycle is unlike
closed loop adsorption refrigeration systems which necessitate condenser
pressure to be higher than evaporator pressure to allow owing of the re-
frigerant from condenser to evaporator [25]. Different evaporator and
condenser water inlet temperatures are investigated with the range of
10每40 ∼C and 5每30 ∼C, respectively. As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, increasing
evaporator water temperature increases daily water production and spe-
cic cooling power. In contrast, decreasing condenser temperature in-
creases cycle outputs due to the decrease in the operating partial
pressure ratio thus allowing desorption process to reach low uptakes. By
changing evaporator water inlet temperature from 10 to 40 ∼C, water pro-
duction increases by 202% from 6.8 to 20.6 m3/tonne﹞ads/day when oper-
ating at 10 ∼C condenser. On the other hand, decreasing condenser water
inlet temperature from 30 to 5 ∼C, increases cycle water outputs by 135%
from 3.2 to 7.5 m3/tonne﹞ads/day at evaporator temperature of 10 ∼C.

Produced chilled water from the adsorption system can be used for
cooling applications like space, process or district cooling [6]. Fig. 9
shows that this system can produce SCP of 225 W/kg for evaporator
inlet temperature ranging from 10 ∼C to 20 ∼C suitable for space cooling.
Also Fig. 9 shows that at evaporator inlet temperature ranging from 30
to 40 ∼C, SCP values can reach 750 W/kg which suitable for process
cooling.
Fig. 10 shows temperature proles of the main system components
at two condenser temperatures of 5 and 30 ∼C while evaporator water

inlet temperature is constant at 10 ∼C. Two line groups appear in these
gures; the rst is denoted by (L) and the other is denoted by (H)
which refer to temperature proles in case of low condenser tempera-
ture of 5 ∼C and high condenser temperature of 30 ∼C respectively.
As seen in Fig. 10-a, at lower condenser water inlet temperature of
5 ∼C with higher water production rates (i.e. higher uptake rate), bed
temperature (point 1) cannot reach the low temperature of 22.8 ∼C
(point 2) at the end of adsorption process and the high temperature of
84.9 ∼C (point 4) like the case of higher condenser temperature. This is
due to the larger amount of heat released and extracted during adsorp-
tion and desorption processes respectively by the adsorbent material. In
Fig. 10-b the hatched area represents the increase in cooling effect pro-
duced in the evaporator due to decreasing the condenser water inlet
temperature which resulted in low evaporator temperature of 8 ∼C. In
contrast, condenser temperature increases in case of 5 ∼C more than in
case of 30 ∼C resulting in area ＆B＊ larger than area ＆A＊, Fig. 10-c, which
is because of larger amount of water produced at lower condenser
water inlet temperature.

5. Numerical simulation and validation

A Simulink model has been developed to simulate the adsorption
water desalination/cooling system shown in Fig. 1. This model has
been validated using the experimental results and then used to predict
the system performance at other operating conditions.

5.1. Numerical model

In order to study the cycle, energy equations are solved for evapora-
tor, condenser, adsorber/desorber bed in addition to mass and salt bal-
ance equations for the evaporator [26] as shown in Eqs. 9每13:

All energy and mass balance equations in addition to adsorbent
characteristics equations (isotherms and kinetics) are solved by
Simulink with tolerance value of 1 ℅ 10 6. In this simulation it was as-
sumed that there is no heat loss from the bed and the temperature of all
constituents of each component are kept at the same temperature
momentarily.

5.2. Validation of numerical model

Results of an experimental test at the operating conditions described
in Section 4 and at evaporator and condenser water temperatures of
10 ∼C were used for validation. Validation of the developed Simulink
model is based on a comparison between experimental and numerical
temperatures of bed, evaporator and condenser as shown in Fig. 11
showing good agreement between the experimental and simulation re-
sults with an error within ㊣ 10% which is presented on Table 5. Fig. 12
compares the experimental and numerical results of daily water pro-
duction and specic cooling power with an error of 7.3 and 6.3%
respectively.
The validated mathematical model was used to investigate the sys-
tem performance at condensing temperature of 30 ∼C and higher bed
heating temperature of 120 ∼C to achieve the same partial pressure as
the case used in the model validation above. Fig. 13 compares the pre-
dicted SDWP and SCP to those produced experimentally at condensing

seen that they comparable with difference b 10%. This illustrates that
as long as the partial pressure ratio is maintained, the performance of
the system will be comparable.

different condenser inlet water temperatures ranging from 5 to 30 ∼C. As
noticed from experimental results in Section 4.3, decreasing condenser
water inlet temperature results in more cooling and water production
where SDWP and SCP increase by 152% and 95% respectively when con-
denser water inlet temperature decreases from 30 to 5 ∼C at 110 ∼C de-
sorption temperature. However, increasing desorption temperature
enhances cycle outputs as SDWP and SCP are increased by 195% and
96% when desorption temperature increases from 110 to 155 ∼C at the
same condenser temperature of 30 ∼C.

6. Conclusions

Adsorption water desalination outperforms conventional desalina-
tion technologies in terms of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and
water production cost. MOF is a new class of porous materials with ex-
ceptionally high water adsorption capabilities. CPO-27Ni is a MOF mate-
rial with higher water uptake value at low partial pressure ratio
compared to silica gel leading to advantages in terms of water desalina-
tion and cooling production. This work experimentally investigates the
use of CPO-27Ni MOF adsorbent material for adsorption desalination/
cooling applications. The effect of operating parameters like evaporator
and condenser water inlet temperatures, half cycle and switching times
on the system performance in terms of specic daily water production
and specic cooling power were investigated. It was shown that a max-
imum water production of 22.8 m3/tonne﹞ads/day was achieved as
well as cooling of 215.9 Rton/tonne adsorbent at maximum evaporator
water inlet temperature of 40 ∼C and condenser water inlet temperature
of 5 ∼C. This is due to the nature of the isotherm curve of CPO-27Ni and
the fact that reducing condenser temperature and increasing evaporator
temperature, maximizes the cycle uptake and hence results in more
cooling and water outputs. In addition, a numerical model was devel-
oped and validated using the experimental results and then used to pre-
dict cycle performance at other operating conditions. From this model, it
was concluded that as long as the partial pressure ratio is maintained,
the same cycle outputs could be obtained using different combinations
between condenser and desorption temperatures.
