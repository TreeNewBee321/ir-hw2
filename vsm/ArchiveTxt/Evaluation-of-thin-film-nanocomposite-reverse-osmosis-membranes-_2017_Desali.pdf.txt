abstract

Nanoparticle addition in the currently widely used thin lm composite (TFC) membranes is a promising technol-
ogy to advance separation performance and bring novel functionality in membrane desalination processes. These
thin lm nanocomposite (TFN) membranes boast many advantages over their TFC counterparts such as increased
water ux without compromising salt rejection and bacterial resistance. However, the stability of TFN mem-
branes is unknown in industrial, long-term applications. Via interfacial polymerization, we synthesized a series
of polyamide TFC and TFN membranes with different nanoparticle content, 0 wt%, 0.15 wt%, 0.30 wt%, in the cast-
ing solutions. At the United States Bureau of Reclamation's Water Quality Improvement Center in Yuma, AZ, the
membranes were tested for ~ 3000 h in a lab-scale testing system. We characterized the physico-chemical nature
and morphology of the membranes before and after the testing. All membranes exhibited relatively stable long-
term separation performances. At the highest zeolite loading tested, in comparison with the TFC membrane,
water permeance increased from 3.7 ㊣ 0.6 米m MPa1 s1 to 5.3 ㊣ 0.5 米m MPa1 s1 and solute rejection slight-
ly increased from 97.4 ㊣ 0.3% to 97.9 ㊣ 0.1%. In this study, TFN membranes exhibited long-term desalination sta-
bility and improved separation performance compared to TFC membranes.

1. Introduction

Reverse osmosis (RO) is a pressure-driven membrane process which
is currently the most dominant technology for water desalination be-
cause of its relatively low energy consumption compared to non-mem-
brane based desalination processes (e.g, thermal processes such as
multi-stage ash and distillation) [1]. From the rst cellulose acetate
membranes to the current polyamide thin lm composite (TFC)
membranes, permeability increased from 1.4 米m MPa 1 s 1 to 5.5每
8.3 米m MPa 1 s 1 for seawater and 8.3每13.9 米m MPa1 s1 for brack-
ish water with very high rejections (N 99%) of ionic solutes, such as
sodium and chloride [2,3]. This technology widely uses the thin lm
composite (TFC) polyamide (PA) membrane which consists of an
interfacially polymerized, ultrathin, crosslinked, aromatic PA layer
onto microporous polysulfone supported by a non-woven polyester
layer. The interfacial polymerization is a complex process involving
the condensation reaction of an amine and an acid chloride at the inter-
face of an aqueous and organic solution [4]. This dense PA structure is
highly salt selective and the thinness of this layer (~ 100 nm) enables
high water permeance in wide temperature and pH ranges [5,6]. Never-
theless, further performance improvement of polyamide TFC mem-
branes in desalination applications is challenging because of two main
factors. First, the ※upper bound§ permeability/selectivity trade-off ob-
served in polymeric membranes for gas separations [7] also constrains
the maximum performance of polymeric desalination membranes [8].
Second, polyamide membranes are susceptible to damage from biolog-
ical fouling, scaling, and free chlorine (the most common disinfection
agent in water treatment) [9,10]. Biolms on the PA surface increase
the resistance of the total membrane, resulting in ux decline and
ultimately in lower membrane performance and lifetime [10]. Some
fouling and scaling may be minimized through appropriate cross-ow
conditions within the RO membrane module to minimize issues with
concentration polarization [11,12]. Although free chlorine is a low-cost
and effective disinfection chemical for reducing biolm layers, the PA
structure degrades after continuous exposure to trace amounts of chlo-
rine (at amounts three orders of magnitude lower than the effective
chlorine present in disinfected water [13]). The PA degradation may re-
sult in increasing the water ux and the salt passage [6,13]. On the other
hand, water permeance, solute rejection, and operational robustness of
the membrane highly affect the energy consumption and operational
costs of RO desalination processes [1,5]. Thus, there is a need to address
these membrane challenges in desalination processes.
Coatings of porous metals, metal oxides, and zeolites are applied to
mesoporous ceramic membranes or metallic membranes formed to
develop mechanically enhanced and chemically durable membranes
for water purication processes [5,14]. Compared to polymeric mem-
branes, defect-free, versatile zeolitic membranes may enhance desalina-
tion performances, however, they have higher membrane production
costs [14,15]. Moreover, because of the rigid structure, zeolitic mem-
branes have lower permeation surface area density in a membrane
module, which may cause an increase in operational costs [14,16].
These membranes are therefore rarely used for commercial desalination
processes [5,15,16].
Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs) have emerged as an alternative
to pure polymeric membranes or zeolitic membranes [17]. MMMs are
composed of an inorganic ller phase dispersed through a continuous
polymer phase. Ideally, the MMM retains the desirable characteristics
of the individual components while obviating their individual disadvan-
tages. MMMs have been studied extensively for gas separation applica-
tions [18,19]. For water separation applications, recent studies of
nanoparticles embedded into the thin lm polyamide structure during
an interfacial polymerization process showed improved membrane per-
formance [20]. In these advanced membranes for water treatement var-
ious nanollers have been studied such as zeolite nanoparticles [21每29],
carbon nanotubes [30每33], silica [34每36], silver [30], and metal oxides
[37]. Superhydrophilic, nanosized Linde Type A (LTA) zeolites have
demonstrated promising results in thin lm nanocomposite (TFN) poly-
amide membranes for RO processes [21,22,24每26]. This zeolite consists
of an aluminosilicate framework with a molecular formula of Na12
[(AlO2)12(SiO2)12]﹞27H2O (lowest possible silicon/aluminum ratio in
LTA is 2). Because of this aluminum rich structure, LTA is a super-hydro-
philic zeolite. However, it may not be stable under acidic environments
[28] (dealumination may occur at low pH [38]). LTA (NaA type) has 3-
dimensional narrow-pores with a diameter of 4.2  [39], which is suit-
able for selecting water, but excluding hydrated ions and small organic
molecules [40,41]. The 3-dimensional structure of the LTA pores ensures
access to the pore regardless of how the zeolite is oriented in the poly-
mer (and is much simpler to embed in membrane structure compared
to 1-dimensional structures such as carbon-nanotubes which require
precise orientation to take advantage of the pore structure). Polyamide
membranes with incorporated LTA nanoparticles are hydrophilic and
have higher ux and similar rejection when compared with commercial
membranes [21,22,24每26]. Furthermore, previous research on TFN
membranes has demonstrated an increase in properties (smoother
and more hydrophilic surfaces) that limit bacterial adhesion to mem-
brane surfaces in short-term bacterial adhesion tests [26]. However,
the performances of TFNs vary as a function of the type, size, and con-
centration of nanoparticles [21,22,24]. In addition, there may be some
※non-ideal effects§ [42] in MMMs such as particle aggregation at higher
zeolite loadings [43] and void or rigidied polymer formation at the
polymer/particle interface [42]. This may result in decreased perfor-
mance of the membrane. In our publication analyzing the permeance
of pure zeolite-4A molecular sieves and nanocomposite zeolite-4A/
polymeric MMMs for water separations, we demonstrated that trans-
port may occur both at the molecular sieve/polymer matrix interface

and through the molecular sieves [44]. However Turgman-Cohen et al.
performed a molecular dynamic simulation study on pressure-driven
water transport through thin lm membranes of LTA zeolite [45].
Based on this simulation result, they hypothesize that preferential ow
may be around the zeolite particles not through the zeolite pores [45].
Reverse osmosis desalination applications are divided into two pri-
mary categories based on feed type: brackish water or sea water. Feed
water salinity ranges determine the type. In 2010, Kurth et al. published
the long-term performance of TFN membranes (with unknown types of
inorganic particles) for seawater desalination [46]. However, to our best
knowledge, no publications report the long-term performance and sta-
bility of TFN membranes for brackish water desalination. The differ-
ences in feed water characteristics such as foulants and salinity, in
addition to the operating conditions such as pressure and temperature,
cause the ux and rejection of the membranes to vary between brackish
water and seawater desalination [47].
The objective of our research is to evaluate the long-term effective-
ness of mixed matrix nanocomposite membranes for treating brackish
water with reverse osmosis (RO) in an operating plant environment.
The ultimate impact of this research is to increase the amount of
available technology for reclaiming and purifying water supplies with
reduced energy demands. This is the rst report on long-term perfor-
mance of TFN membranes with brackish feed waters.

2. Experimental methods

2.1. Materials

Chemicals used in this manuscript are referred to with the following
nomenclature. We used a polysulfone coated non-woven polyester ul-
traltration membrane (PSf, NanoH2O) as a support membrane. We
prepared monomer solutions of meta-phenylene diamine (MPD, 99%,
Sigma-Aldrich) in ultrapure deionized water (milli-Q water, Millipore),
and trimesoyl chloride (TMC, 98%, Spectrum) in the organic solvent
Isoparran-G (Isopar-G, Sigma-Aldrich), for the synthesis of the thin
polyamide lm. We used freeze dried powdered Linde type A zeolites
(LTA, 4A, Na+, NanoScape) with an ~ 100 nm mean particle size. The
post-cure rinses consisted of solutions of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl,
reagent grade, Sigma-Aldrich) and sodium bisulte (NaHSO3, reagent
grade, Sigma-Aldrich).

2.2. Membrane synthesis

Our casting procedure is based on previously published methods
[21,22,25,26]. Thin lm composite (TFC) membranes are pure polyam-
ide membranes without nanoparticles. Thin lm nanocomposite (TFN)
membranes are similar polyamide membranes, with nanoparticles dis-
persed in the TMC-Isopar-G monomer solution.
First, we prepared the MPD in water and TMC in organic solvent
monomer solutions separately. The solutions were magnetically stirred
at 300 rpm for at least 3 h prior to use.
For the casting, a sheet of polysulfone coated polyester support
membrane was taped on all sides onto a glass plate. Then, we soaked
the support into 3.5 wt% MPD in milli-Q water monomer solution for
2 min, with the active side (PSf side) facing down in the solution and
the back of the plate not submerged. After lifting the plate from the
amine solution, to increase the uniformity of the membrane surface,
we removed the excess solution from the surface with a rubber nger-
print ink roller. Then, we immediately placed the MPD coated mem-
brane vertically into a monomer solution of 0.15 wt% TMC in isopar-G
for the interfacial polymerization reaction. After 1 min, we removed
the plate from the solution and held it vertically for 2 min. We cured
the membrane through a series of post-treatment rinses. First, the
membrane was placed into a water bath at ~ 95 ∼C with active side up
for 2 min. Then, the membrane was removed from the glass plate and
placed into 1.5 mL L1 NaOCl in deionized water for 2 min. We believe

that NaOCl removes the unreacted MPD on the structure. Next, the
membrane was placed into 1 g L 1 NaHSO3 in deionized water for
30 s. We believe NaHSO3 neutralizes the unreacted NaOCl, which pro-
tects the polyamide from degradation caused by the chlorine. Finally,
the membrane was placed into a fresh water bath at ~ 95 ∼C with active
side down for 2 min. The resulting membranes were placed into 1 L of
milli-Q water in a light-proof Nalgene bottle until testing.
The only difference between the TFC and TFN membrane synthesis
procedures is that we dispersed LTA zeolite nanoparticles in the TMC-
isopar G solution with ultra-sonication at 20 ∼C for 30 min. We poured
the sonicated solution into the membrane vertical solution holder im-
mediately prior to the polymerization reaction.
For this work, we synthesized three types of polyamide/LTA zeolite
thin lm membranes, each with a different zeolite loading: 0 wt%,
0.15 wt%, 0.30 wt% of nanoparticles in the TMC-organic solution. The
names of each membrane set are TFC, TFN 0.15, and TFN 0.30,
respectively.

2.3. Long-term performance test

The operators at the United States Bureau of Reclamation Water
Quality Improvement Center (WQIC) in Yuma, AZ tested the hand-
cast membranes synthesized at ASU nearly continuously in a small-
scale 9-cell cross-ow test unit, as depicted in Fig. 1, for approximately
3000 h with an applied hydraulic pressure of 200 psi. They placed nine
different samples into the nine cell WQIC system (in which the cells are
in series) in such a way that, for each zeolite loading, two samples were
taken from the rst membrane and one sample from the second mem-
brane with the same nanoparticle loading. In total, three TFC, three TFN
0.15, and three TFN 0.30 membrane coupons were tested during the
long-term performance test. The feed ow rate of the system was
1.5 gal min 1 and the effective membrane area tested for each cell
was 18.37 cm2. Prior to sending the membrane coupons to the WQIC
for long term testing, we conrmed their defect-free nature through
short term water ux and rejection measurements in a cross-ow labo-
ratory-scale RO system at ASU.
At the WQIC, our membranes were tested with feed of controlled
waters without pH adjustment. The WQIC operators measured ow
rate, conductivity, temperature and pressure measurements every
12 h for both feed and permeate products. They also took the pH and
free chlorine measurements of the feed. Additionally, once a week
they analyzed the feed composition. Table 1 gives the key feed water pa-
rameters. The feed had a relatively narrow pH range, low chlorine con-
centration and dissolved salt content. The feed also had a low fouling
character (total organic content b 0.5 mg L 1).

To evaluate the membrane performances, we obtained the salt
water ux (J) [米m s 1] from the ow rate divided by the membrane
area. We calculated observed water permeance (A), often called the
water permeability coefcient, by normalizing the ux by the applied
pressure (忖P) and the osmotic pressure (忖羽) difference as A = J/
(忖P  忖羽) [米m MPa 1 s 1]. In addition, we calculated the observed re-
jection from R = 1  Cp/Cf where Cp and Cf [S cm 1] were the conduc-
tivity of the permeate and the feed solution respectively. The salt
permeance (B) was determined by B = J(1  R)/R [米m s 1]. Finally,
we calculated the water-salt permselectivity (A/B) by A/B = R/(忖P 
忖羽)(1  R) [MPa 1]. In our calculations, to evaluate the membranes
under the same conditions, we calculated the performances under ob-
served condition and assumed no concentration polarization (for low
salinity water testing under low pressure, the assumption may valid
[48]).

2.4. Membrane characterization

We measured the contact angles of the membranes with de-ionized
water sessile drop contact angle analysis (Easy Drop; Krss) to evaluate
surface hydrophilicity of all membranes. The drop volume of the water
was 1 米L. The steady-state values of the angles on both sides of the drop
were measured on air-dried samples. Twelve measurements were
taken on each membrane sample. We removed the highest and the low-
est values, and reported the average value and the standard deviation of
the remaining measurements. We used attenuated total reectance每
Fourier transform infrared (ATR每FTIR, 6700 FTIR; Thermo Nicolet)
with diamond crystal smart orbit to provide insight into the functional-
ity of the thin lm. We dried the membrane samples in a desiccator
overnight prior to ATR-FTIR measurement. We used scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, ESEM XL-30, Philips) to determine the surface mor-
phology of the membranes at various magnications. Dried membrane
samples were sputter coated with Au

quantify roughness of the dried membranes at a xed scanning rate of
1 Hz. The tip radius was 8每12 nm, the cantilever length was 215每
235 米m with a spring constant of 3 N m 1. For AFM analysis, three mea-
surements were taken on each sample for 25 米m2 scan area. We
employed the tapping mode because polymers could be easily damaged
by the tip. We reported the roughness in terms of the root-mean
squared (RMS) roughness, the standard deviation of the averaged
roughness, and surface area difference (SAD), the increase of the 3-D
surface area over the 2-D surface area.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Long term performance evaluation

The operators at the WQIC collected data from the system twice a
day for 2760 h; they emailed the raw data to ASU where we analyzed
it. Operating conditions such as pressure and temperature govern re-
verse osmosis performance. Pressure difference is the driving force for
water ux, however the pressure difference does not have a large inu-
ence on salt passage. Consequently, separation performance is en-
hanced with increasing applied pressure. However, high applied
pressure results in increased power consumption and operational
costs. In our experiment, the system had overall stable pressure except
on three occasions. There was a sudden pressure increase at 174 h into
the test, a scheduled plant water supply outage at 996 h into the test and
a pump failure at 1765 h into the test. Abrupt pressure changes might
lead to possible membrane damage.
In addition, the temperature of the WQIC feed uctuates throughout
the day; there is an overall increase in daily temperature with time dur-
ing the testing period. The measurements were taken twice daily at ap-
proximately the same times each day, and the temperature uctuates
(because the test started in May and ended in September). Therefore,
the feed temperature increased as a result of the external weather dur-
ing the long-term test. Feed viscosity, salt diffusivity and concentration
polarization are largely dependent on temperature. Increases in tem-
perature enhance the water and salt permeation through the mem-
brane, thus, the ux performance increases and the salt rejection
performance decreases [49,50].
In addition to pressure and temperature, feed composition also has
an effect on the membrane performance. Conductivity (proportional
to the concentration of total dissolved salts) and pH (concentration of
hydronium ions) can be used to evaluate the feed composition effect
on the long-term tests. However, conductivity and pH are functions of
temperature [51,52]. Moreover, during the test, the feed composition
also changed independently from the temperature. Therefore, we
could not distinguish the actual individual contributions of composition,
temperature, and pH on our tested membranes. But still we examined
the ux response to the changed parameters in terms of stability. We
concluded that the performance stabilities are similar for TFC and TFN
membranes for brackish water desalination.
We averaged the performances of the samples for each membrane
set, TFC, TFN 0.15, and TFN 0.30. Fig. 2 presents the averaged perfor-
mance results (water ux Fig. 2a, salt rejection Fig. 2b, water-salt
permselectivity Fig. 2c) and Table 2 exhibits all the averaged perfor-
mance results (water ux, salt rejection, water permeance, salt
permeance, water/salt permselectivity). The average brackish water

permeance of the membranes with 0 wt%, 0.15 wt% and 0.30 wt% zeolite
loadings were calculated as 3.7 ㊣ 0.6, 4.7 ㊣ 0.3 and 5.3 ㊣ 0.5 米m MPa 1-
s 1, respectively. There is a 21% permeance increase for TFN 0.15 mem-
branes compared to TFC membranes (with no zeolites). Moreover, the
permeance improvement for TFN 0.30 membranes is 43% compared to
the TFC membranes. These results show that water permeance in-
creases with the zeolite loading, as expected. We obtained the maxi-
mum salt rejection for TFN 0.30 membranes of 97.9 ㊣ 0.1%. We
obtained similar salt rejection for TFC and TFN 0.15 membranes,
97.4 ㊣ 0.3% and 97.2 ㊣ 1.0% respectively.
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the performance results indicate that all the
membranes recovered their performance after the rst abrupt pressure
change (around 174 h) and the scheduled water outage (around 996 h).
However, after the pump failure (at 1765 h), one of the TFN 0.15 mem-
brane had a dramatic decrease in the salt rejection performance. After
that, it took 3每4 days for the membrane to partially recover its pre-out-
age performance. After the recovery, its average salt rejection was re-
corded as 95.3 ㊣ 0.4% compared to 98.2 ㊣ 0.1% before the pump
failure. Upon examination of the membrane surfaces after the end of
the long-term test at the WQIC, we also observed color changes on the
edges of active side surface of one of the three TFN 0.15 membranes.
We did not observe such color changes on the other membranes. We
hypothesize that there was damage to the membrane surface resulting
from the abrupt pressure change created by the power failure, and that
this damage inuenced the salt rejection.

3.1. Membrane properties

We performed sessile drop contact angle analysis for all membranes
before and after the performance test. Because of the presence of super-
hydrophilic nanoparticles, other researchers have found that thin lm
mixed matrix membranes show lower pure water contact angle than
corresponding thin lm polymer membranes [22,24,25]. Therefore, we
expected to observe smaller contact angles with increasing zeolite con-
tent. However, as seen in Fig. 3, before the performance test, TFN

membranes demonstrated higher average water contact angle results
than corresponding TFC membranes. We hypothesize this unexpected
result is partially attributable to the presence of zeolite aggregation
which yields a rough non-uniform surface. This hypothesis may also ex-
plain the decrease in contact angle values after the performance test.
Previously, we have observed aggregation of LTA zeolite nanoparticles
in polyamide membranes. Mechanical compaction during the perfor-
mance test may release any loosely bonded zeolite clumps from the
membrane surface, which could result in the observed decrease in the
contact angle values of TFN membranes compare the values of before
performance test.

branes in the range from 1800 cm 1 to 750 cm 1 before and after the

provides the percentage difference between the three dimensional sur-
face area over the two dimensional surface area. Larger RMS and SAD
values correspond to rougher membranes [25]. Before the performance
test, while TFN 0.15 membranes had smallest RMS values, TFN 0.30
membranes have signicantly higher RMS value than TFC membranes.
For TFN 0.30 membranes, due to structural difference and/or zeolite ag-
gregation, we might have higher roughness difference. Compaction of
the membrane coupled with washing off of zeolite aggregates could ac-
count for the observed reduction in RMS value after the performance
test for the TFN 0.30 membranes. In addition, we observed increased
roughness for TFC and TFN 0.15 membranes after the performance
test compared to untested membranes. Surface deposition of potential
foulants or scalants might explain this behavior. Generally, others
have observed that TFN membranes were rougher with more surface
area compared to TFC membranes [25]. According to our SAD results,
prior to the performance test, our TFN membranes were rougher with
increased zeolite loading. This result correlated with our contact angle
as well as water permeance results. However, after the performance
test, the high zeolite loaded TFN membranes SAD results shows that
they become smoother during the performance test. We hypothesized
that the aggregated zeolites might be washed off creating smoother
membrane surfaces. Table 3 summarizes the membrane physical prop-
erty characterization for the membranes before and after the long-term
performance test.

4. Conclusions

We evaluated the long-term performance of our hand-cast thin
lm composite and thin lm nanocomposite membranes. Except for
a scheduled plant water supply outage and a pump failure, our

overcome the zeolite aggregation problem [24]. In the future, applying
this procedure may minimize particle aggregation in thin lm mixed
matrix membranes.
We examined the surface morphologies of the WQIC tested mem-
branes with SEM after completion of the long-term testing. The repre-
sentative images are in Fig. 7. We did not observe a signicant
polyamide structure change. Fouling leads to decreased membrane
permeance and decreased salt rejection [10]. Because we did not have
signicant membrane performance impairment and the feed had low
organic content, we expected a negligible fouling rate in this experi-
ment. Indeed, we noticed minimal deposition on and color change of
the membrane surface. Visually, the higher zeolite loaded TFN mem-
branes have the cleanest surfaces.
Fig. 8 presents atomic force microscopy analysis. We quantied sur-
face roughness of all membranes with two parameters: root mean
square roughness (RMS) and surface area difference (SAD). RMS repre-
sents the standard deviation of the height values within a scan area. SAD

membranes were tested for approximately 3000 h in an operating plant
environment. All TFN membranes demonstrated higher salt water ux
than the TFC membranes while maintaining similar average salt rejec-
tion. The TFN membranes with 0.15 wt% LTA content had a 1.3 times
higher water permeance than the TFC membranes and those with
0.30 wt% LTA content had a 1.4 times higher water permeance than
the TFC membranes. In addition, TFN membranes had higher salt
selectivity than the TFC membranes (TFN 0.15 and TFN 0.30 membranes
exhibited 1.4 and 1.8 times higher permselectivities than TFC mem-
branes). The long-term performance data demonstrate that increases
in zeolite loading enhanced long-term separation performance (both
water permeance and salt selectivity) for brackish water reverse osmo-
sis desalination.
Our results show that thin lm nanocomposite membranes had
stable long-term ux and rejection performance in comparison to
thin lm composite membranes. However, we did not evaluate the
membranes under high fouling and extreme pH conditions. In addi-
tion the membranes did not experience cleaning or chemical treat-
ments . Thus , there is a need for cont inued research into the ir
tolerance to harsh fouling and chemical env ironments to validate
their possible contr ibut ion to reduce the energy consumpt ion for
brackish water desalination.
