abstract

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) lter and marginal distribution Bayes (MDB) lter are two ef- 
cient Bayes approaches for multi-target tracking. However, these two lters fail to provide the state 
estimation of a target during its initial times due to the poor capability of the two lters on the target 
detection. To enhance the capability of the MDB lter on the target detection, we present a method for 
the target detection based on the rule-based track initiation technique, and develop a multi-target Bayes 
lter with the target detection by applying this target detection method to the MDB lter. Simulation 
results indicate that this lter has a stronger detecting and tracking capability of the target than the 
existing PHD and MDB lters.

1. Introduction 

Multi-target tracking has attracted the attentions of researchers 
due to its wide applications in civil and military elds. This prob- 
lem was discussed in many articles and a lot of tracking theo- 
ries and algorithms of multiple targets were established in the 
past decades [1每31] . Traditional approaches for this problem use 
the measurements obtained by a sensor at several different times 
to detect new targets and establish new trajectories, and assign 
the measurement for each existing target to maintain its trajec- 
tory [1每4] . As the nite set statistics was established by Mahler, 
many novel Bayes tracking algorithms for multiple targets were 
developed in recent years. The remarkable achievements in this 
aspect include Mahler＊s probability hypothesis density (PHD) l- 
ter [5每6] , Vo＊s Gaussian mixture PHD lter [7] , particle PHD l- 
ter [8每10] and their extensions [11每25] . The optimal multi-target 
Bayes lter propagates the joint posterior density of the multi- 
target state through its prediction and update equations, which is 
generally intractable because of the set integrals in the prediction 
and update equations of the lter. This intractability is alleviated in 
Mahler＊s PHD lter because it propagates the rst-order moment 
of the joint posterior density in the lter recursion [6] . However, 
the prediction and update equations of the PHD lter still involve 
multiple dimension integrals and are also intractable in general. 
Therefore, further approximation of the PHD lter is usually re- 
quired [7,11] . Using a Gaussian mixture to represent the posterior 
intensity, Vo developed an implementation of the PHD lter for the 
linear Gaussian system, and extended this implementation to the 
nonlinear Gaussian system [7] . By applying the switching multi- 
ple models into Vo＊s Gaussian mixture PHD lter, Pasha proposed 
a Gaussian mixture PHD lter to track the maneuvering target that 
switches among several linear Gaussian models [12] . Adaptive tar- 
get birth intensity techniques were also investigated independently 
in [13, 14] and [15] to avoid the requirement for exact knowledge 
of the birth target. To improve the stability of the target number 
estimation, the cardinalized PHD lter was developed in [16] to 
propagate the cardinality and moment in the lter recursion. In 
addition to the Gaussian mixture approach, the particle or sequen- 
tial Monte Carlo approach is another approximation of the PHD l- 
ter [8每10] . The drawback of this approximation is that it requires 
a higher computational load than the Gaussian mixture approxi- 
mation because a large number of particles need to be sampled in 
this approximation. 
The main differences between the PHD lter and the traditional 
tracking approach are that the PHD lter avoids the data associ- 
ation which is used in the traditional approach to establish the 
new trajectories and maintain the existing trajectories [5每8] and 
that the PHD lter may provide the estimation of the target num- 
ber. However, the PHD lter is prone to discard the information of 
a target if the target is missing from the measurement of a sen- 
sor. Besides, the PHD lter is not applicable to the closely spaced 
targets because it cannot distinguish distinct targets if these tar- 
gets have a small separation [6] . To track the closely spaced tar- 
gets more eciently, Liu developed the marginal distribution Bayes 
(MDB) lter [27,28] . Unlike the PHD lter that propagates the rst- 
order moment, the MDB lter transmits the marginal distribution 
and existence probability of each target in the lter＊s recursion. 
Based on the MDB lter, Liu also developed a sequential multi- 
target MDB lter to track multiple targets [29] . The advantage of 
the sequential MDB lter is that it may handle the received mea- 
surements in real time and is more applicable to tracking the mul- 
tiple targets than the PHD lter in case of low detection proba- 
bility. By applying the switching multiple models and the adap- 
tive estimating technique of turn rate to the sequential MDB lter, 
respectively, Liu proposed a sequential multiple target Bayes lter 
with jump Markov system models [30] and a multi-target Bayes 
lter with adaptive estimation of turn rate [31] to track the multi- 
ple maneuvering targets and the turn maneuvering targets, respec- 
tively. Similar to the PHD lter, Liu＊s MDB lters also avoid the data 
association that is usually used in the traditional approach of tar- 
get tracking. The performance of these MDB lters have also been 
analyzed and examined through simulation experiments [27每31] . 
Available research results have demonstrated that Vo＊s PHD l- 
ter and Liu＊s MDB lter are ecient for multi-target tracking in 
the presence of clutter and noise [7,27,29] . However, these two l- 
ters fail to provide the state estimation of a target during its initial 
times due to the poor capability of these two lters on the target 
detection. The track initiation technique in the traditional tracking 
approaches [32] may provide an ecient solution for this prob- 
lem. The objective of this technique is to detect a new target and 
initialize its track whenever the new target appears in the surveil- 
lance space. In [32] , the two sequential track initiation techniques, 
namely, the rule-based technique and logic-based technique, are 
investigated. Based on the rule-based track initiation technique, an 
approach for the target detection by using the measurements ob- 
tained by the radar at three different scanning periods is presented 
in this paper. Applying the target detection approach to the MDB 
lter, we develop the MDB lter with the target detection to en- 
hance the capability of the MDB lter on detecting multiple tar- 
gets, which is also the main contribution of this paper. In terms of 
the OSPA distance [33] , the tracking performance of the proposed 
lter is demonstrated by comparing it with Vo＊s Gaussian mixture 
PHD lter and Liu＊s MDB lter, which indicates that the proposed 
lter is best at detecting and tracking multiple targets among these 
lters. Please note that the target detection method presented in 
this paper may also be applied to the PHD lter to enhance its 
capability on detecting multiple targets because of the similarity 
between the MDB lter and PHD lter. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The target de- 
tection technique used in this paper is described in Section 2 . The 
multi-target Bayes lter with the target detection is developed in 
Section 3 . The performance of the developed lter is evaluated in 
Section 4 . Conclusion is drawn in Section 5 . 

2. Target detection method 

Track initiation techniques have been investigated in [32] . Based 
on the rule-based track initiation technique, we will present the 
target detection approach to detect the new target and estimate its 
initial state vectors by using three measurement sets that are ob- 
tained by the radar at three different scanning periods. The radar 
measures the range and azimuth of the target, and its measure- 
ment in polar coordinates is denoted by

After the state estimations of a detected target are obtained,

have to be abandoned from sets Z k

By repeating the aforementioned method, we may detect indi-

tage of the target detection method is that it may provide the state 
estimations of individual detected targets at times t k

which is extremely important for tracking these detected targets at 
subsequent times.

3. Mult-target Bayes lter with the target detection 

We have presented the multi-target Bayes lter in [27] and 
[29] . In this section, we apply the target detection method in 
Section 2 to the multi-target Bayes lter in [29] to design a multi- 
target Bayes lter with the target detection. The novel lter is de- 
scribed as follows: 
Step 1: Prediction 
In this step, we use marginal distribution N (
and existence probability 
of distinct targets at time step k 
1 to predict their marginal distribution and existence probability at 
time step k where i 
 1 . The predicted marginal distribution 
and N k 
denotes the number 
of targets at time step k 
and existence probability are as follows:

Step 2: Classication of measurements 
In this step, we split measurement set Z k 
 at 
time step k , where M k 
denotes the number of measurements, into 
two categories according to the following procedures: 
We rst use converted measurement z j, k 
to compute the probability 
as

 5 , which indi- 
is originated from an existing target. Otherwise, we clas- 
into the second category, which suggests z j, k 
is a clutter- 
originated measurement or a measurement originated from a new 
target. 
Addressing each measurement in measurement set Z k 
(
)
 according to the aforementioned method, we may 
split measurement set Z k 
into two categories. The measurements 
in the rst category and second category are denoted by sets Z

We export the state estimations of each detected target at time

steps k , k 
 1 and k 
 2 , respectively. At the same time, we add the 
steps k , k 
marginal distributions and existence probabilities of the detected 
targets at time step k to those of the existing targets at time step 
k to form the marginal distributions and existence probabilities of 
individual targets at time step k , and transmit them, along with 
measurement sets Z 
and Z 
, to the next time step. The pseudo- 
Code for the multi-target Bayes lter with the target detection is 
given in Fig. 2 . 
The advantages of the multi-target Bayes lter with the target 
detection over the PHD and MDB lters are as follows: (1) It may 
provide the initial state estimations of the detected target, which 
is extremely important for tracking the target at subsequent times. 
(2) It propagates less Gaussian terms to the next time step because

only the Gaussian terms relevant to the existing targets and de- 
tected targets are propagated to the next time step. 
Remark : The initial position, velocity and error covariance of 
the detected targets or newly appearing targets provided in the 
developed lter are accurate, whereas the initial velocity of newly 
appearing targets is usually assumed to be zero and their initial 
error covariance is generally chosen based on the maximal target 
velocity in the PHD lter and MDB lter [14] . In this case, the in- 
accuracy in the initial state and error covariance of new targets 
becomes larger, which may lead to a failure of target detection or 
track initialization [14] . 

4. Simulation results 

We use three examples to reveal the performance of the MDB 
lter with the target detection. The rst is to show the perfor- 
mance of this lter for two targets with the constant velocity in 
the absence of missed detection, clutter and noise. The second is to 
reveal the tracking performance of this lter for eight targets with 
the constant velocity in the presence of missed detection, clutter 
and noise. The third is to demonstrate the performance of this l- 
ter for eight targets with the constant acceleration in the presence 
of missed detection, clutter and noise. In the experiments, we use 
Vo＊s PHD lter and Liu＊s MDB lter as the comparing objects, and 
select OSPA distance [33] with parameters c 
 10 m and p 
 2 as 
the measure. The state transition matrix 

in Eqs. (22) and 
(23) , covariance matrix Q k 
in Eq. (23) , observation matrix H k 
in Eqs. (24) , (26) , (27) , (28) and (29) are identical to matrices 
in [29] , respectively, where 
denotes the vari- 
ance of process noise. The converted measurement in Eq. (2) and 
converted error covariance in Eq. (3) are used in the proposed 
lter, Vo＊s PHD lter and Liu＊s MDB lter. The parameters v min

the measurements by the proposed lter, Vo＊s PHD lter and Liu＊s 
MDB lter and MDB lter, respectively. Figs. 3 and 4 show the ex- 
perimental result and a detail view of this result, respectively. 

The proposed lter uses the measurements from three consec- 
utive scanning periods to detect the targets and estimate their ini- 
tial states. Due to this fact, although the two targets appear at 
t 
 1 s in this example, the proposed lter detects the two targets 
at t 
 3 s and obtains their initial state estimations at this time. 
Figs. 3 and 4 reveal that suciently small OSPA distances appear at 
the plot of the proposed lter at t 
 2 s and t 
 3 s because 
the proposed lter may provide the accurate state estimations of 
the two targets at t 
 2 s and t 
 3 s when they are de- 
tected at t 
 3 s , whereas Vo＊s PHD lter and Liu＊s MDB lter fail to 
provide the state estimations of the two targets at t 
 1 s because 
of their poor capacity on the target detection. Fig. 4 also reveals 
that the PHD and MDB lters have larger OSPA distances at t 
t 
 3 s and several subsequent times than the proposed lter. The 
reason for this phenomenon is that the proposed lter provides 
much more accurate state estimations than the PHD and MDB l- 
ters at these times because it has a strong detecting capability of 
the target.

and also reveals that the proposed lter performs better than Vo＊s 
PHD lter or Liu＊s MDB lter because its average OSPA distance 
is the least at each time. This performance advantage of the pro- 
posed lter appears more obvious from t 
 1 s to 8 s because it 
has a strong detecting capability of the target. Fig. 7 also shows 
that the proposed lter may track the detected targets better than 
Vo＊s PHD lter or Liu＊s MDB lter at the subsequent times (from 
t

To handle the converted measurements, identical parameters to 
Example 2 are also used to set the proposed lter in this exam- 
ple. We use Vo＊s PHD lter, Liu＊s MDB lter and proposed lter to 
handle the converted measurements for 120 Monte Carlo runs, and 
show the experimental result in Fig. 10 . Based on Fig. 10 , similar 
conclusion to Example 2 is also drawn. The proposed lter is the 
best among these three lters due to its strong detecting capabil- 
ity of the target. In addition, the result in Fig. 10 suggests that the 
lter with the motion model of constant velocity may be applied 
for tracking the targets that move at a constant acceleration. 
Computational complexity : The proposed lter is originated 
from Liu＊s MDB lter. The difference between them is that Liu＊s 
MDB lter uses the measurements at current time to generate the 
new marginal distributions, whereas the developed method rst 
splits current measurements into two categories and then use the 
second category of measurements from three consecutive times to 
detect individual targets and estimate their initial states. Due to 
the similarity between the proposed lter and MDB lter, its com- 
putational complexity is identical to that of Liu＊s MDB lter or Vo＊s 
PHD lter. The computational complexity of the proposed lter is

5. Conclusions 

In this research, we present a target detection method based on 
the rule-based track initiation technique. This approach uses the 
measurements obtained at three consecutive times to detect indi- 
vidual targets and estimate their initial states. Applying this tar- 
get detection method to the MDB lter, we develop a multi-target 
Bayes lter with the target detection. Its performance is tested by 
comparing it with Vo＊s PHD lter and Liu＊s MDB lter, which in- 
dicates that this lter has a stronger capability on detecting and 
tracking multiple targets than Vo＊s PHD lter or Liu＊s MDB lter. 
The extension of the applicable scope of the proposed lter and 
further improvement on its tracking performance are potential re- 
search topics for the multi-target Bayes lter with the target de- 
tection in the future.

spite the identical computational complexity, The proposed lter 
requires less computational load than Vo＊s PHD lter or Liu＊s MDB 
lter due to the fact that N k 
in the proposed lter approximates 
the number of real targets in the scene because only the marginal 
distributions and existence probabilities of the existing targets and 
detected targets are propagated to the next time step in the lter 
recursion, whereas Vo＊s PHD lter or Liu＊s MDB lter may propa- 
gate many Gaussian terms irrelevant to real targets, along with the 
Gaussian terms relevant to real targets, to the next time step. This 
performance advantage of the proposed lter is validated by the 
average performing times in Examples 2 and 3 . Based on Table 1 , 
the proposed lter requires much less performing time than Vo＊s
