abstract


Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) is one of the commonly used congurations of membrane distilla-
tion technology for water desalination. In the present study, comprehensive investigations on different parame-
ters affecting the performance of the DCMD system are presented. The investigated variables include the hot feed
and the cold permeate temperatures, feed-permeate temperature difference and ratio, feed and permeate ow
rates, feed-permeate ow rate ratio, feed concentration, membrane pore size, and membrane degradation
with time, etc. An analytical model, based on the heat and mass transfer equations within the DCMD module,
was used to predict the system performance at different operating conditions. The model was used to predict
the temperature difference across the membrane surfaces and then calculating the vapor pressure difference
leading to the permeate ux. The model was validated with the experimental measurements. The permeate
ux increases with increasing the feed temperature, feed ow rate, permeate ow rate, and pore size, and de-
creases with increasing the permeate temperature and feed concentration. The productivity of the system is
very promising since a permeate ux of 100 kg/m2°§h was achieved at 90 °„C for hot feed side and 5 °„C for cold
side stream. The DCMD system is able to handle feeds with high salt concentration of 100 g/L with remarkably
high salt rejection factor and low permeate total dissolved solids (TDS). The SEM micrographs showed the
used polytetrauoroethylene (PTFE) membrane covered with a fouling layer, as compared to the as-received
membrane, which attests the need for feed pretreatment and/or membrane washing to recover the membrane
performance. The evaporative (thermal) efciency ranged from 70% to 95% and the GOR values ranged from
0.8 to 1.2 corresponding to feed temperature from 40 °„C to 90 °„C, depending mainly on the feed temperature.

1. Introduction

Many countries worldwide suffer from real water shortage caused
by the rapid population growth, economic development, and
diminishing nature water resources. Projections increase of N 2% in
fresh water demand has been reported in many countries which is
almost double their population growth rates [1]. It is predicted that
some regions of the world will be plagued by water scarcity [2®C5] main-
ly due to the economic growth and development. Shortage of fresh
water can be solved by desalination processes in which substantial
amount of energy to be used [6,7]. Presently, 50% of the world's total de-
salination capacity is based on membrane using the concept of reverse
osmosis, and the remaining shares are by thermal processes such as
the multi-stage ashing (MSF), the multi effect desalination (MED),
vapor compression (VC) and adsorption desalination (AD). The
thermally-based (non-membrane) desalination methods are domi-
nantly used in the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries [8,
9]. The major reasons for adopting the thermal methods in the GCC
countries are; rstly, the high feed salinity in the Gulf and the fouling
susceptibility of membranes at high brine concentration limits the
water recovery ratio of RO process. Secondly, the frequent occurrences
of harmful algae blooms (HABs) in the water of Gulf tend to contain
high concentration of toxins in seawater feed that may pass through
the membrane pores, causing human illnesses and death if the toxins
are ingested [3].
There is a rapid growth in using membrane technologies for water
desalination. Membrane distillation (MD) is one of those technologies
that have a potential and can be applied to produce distillate water
from seawater and brackish water. It involves a hydrophobic micropo-
rous membrane that separates water vapor from the salty feed water.
Hydrophobicity of membrane disallows water in liquid form because
of surface tension but vapor can pass through. The driving force of per-
meation across the membrane is the vapor partial pressure difference of
the two streams on the membrane sides, which is a function of the tem-
perature difference across the membrane. In direct contact membrane
distillation (DCMD) design, vaporization takes place at the liquid-
vapor interface at the membrane pore surface in the feed side. Vapor
is then permeates through the pores from the hot side to the cold side
due to the difference in vapor pressure across the membrane (capillary
action). The permeated vapor is then condensed in the cold stream side
of the membrane [10]. DCMD is not only limited to water purication
but can also be used for treatment of very high concentrations such as
oileld produced water [11]. Macedonio et el. reported that a good
salt rejection factor can be obtained by desalinating water that is obtain-
ed after oileld treatment by using Polypropylene (PP) and
polyvinydene uoride (PVDF) membranes at high ow rates of feed
and coolant. Manawi et al. [12] determined the effect of temperature
polarization on the permeate ux by measuring intermediate tempera-
tures on membrane surface. They developed a multi-dimensional
model in order to estimate temperatures at different points on mem-
brane surface, and optimized the permeate ux by minimizing temper-
ature polarization coefcient. The effect of feed water salinity was
studied by Hsu et al. [13], using a NaCl-H2O solution and seawater as
feeds. They compared the performances of both systems, and they
used ultrasonic technique for cleaning purpose.
Boubakri et al. [14] performed DCMD experiments using PP mem-
brane with a low pore size of 0.064 ¶Ãm. They reported that the permeate
ux reached 4.24 L/m2 h at a temperature difference of 60 °„C and Reyn-
olds number (Re) of 3740. Lin et al. [15] presented a comprehensive en-
ergy analysis of MD-HX system and dened optimum relative ow
rates, mass recovery rates, and specic heat duty for the system. They
coupled MD module with a heat exchanger in order to recover latent
of condensation of vapors in the coolant stream using a circular module.
Srisurichan et al. [16] investigated the mass transport and fouling mech-
anism in DCMD system. They suggested that molecular diffusion model
was the best one for diffusion in fouling related phenomenon. The effect
of coolant velocity is not well explained in literature. Some researchers
have a point of view of decreasing ux by increasing permeate velocity
while others have an opposite viewpoint. Naidu et al. [17] reported that
a velocity ranging between 0.8 and 1.2 m/s was optimum for feed and
permeate sides. Ho et.al. [18] studied the effect of channel smoothness
and ow direction and used eddy promoter to make roughened surface
channels for feed and permeate. They reported that the counter-current
direction ow resulted in higher permeate ux than concurrent ow ar-
rangement. Qtaishat et al. [19]. presented a detailed analysis of the heat
transfer in DCMD through a mathematical model. The coupled effect of
mass and heat transfers was addressed and an experimental validation
was presented. Performance indicators such as the temperature polari-
zation coefcient, the membrane mass transfer coefcient and the
evaporation efciency were discussed. Andrjesd®Ættir [10] investigated
a different forms of dusty gas model utilized for mass transfer. Different

heat and mass transfer correlations were tested, and the transitional
model was found to give the best correlation. The model was also
used by Dahiru and Khalifa [20]. Depending upon the pore size, a
three-parameter model namely Knudsen diffusion, Molecular diffusion,
and Poiseullie ow is considered. Transition model (KMPT) was intro-
duced by Ding et al. [21] to predict membrane distillation coefcient.
For large pores, dominating Poiseullie ow was observed. Therefore,
two or three of the three mechanisms (Knudsen, molecular, Poiseullie)
could be present in a single membrane. Martinez and Diaz [22] devel-
oped a model depending on dusty gas model of gas transport through
membrane pores. The model showed a good agreement with the exper-
imental values.
In this paper, a comprehensive study on the main variables affecting
the DCMD performance and degradation is presented, both experimen-
tally and analytically. The investigated variables included feed tempera-
ture, cold permeate temperature, feed-to-permeate temperature
difference and ratio, feed ow rate, permeate ow rate, feed-to-perme-
ate ow rate ratio, feed concentration up to 100 g/L, membrane pore
size, and membrane degradation with time. The membranes used
were characterized and the effects of continuous operation on the mem-
brane surface and system performance were investigated. The analytical
model is based on solving the equations of heat and mass transfer with-
in the DCMD module.

2. Mathematical modelling

2.1. Mass transfer

Fig. 1 shows the conguration of DCMD module. The hot feed stream
ows over a hydrophobic membrane. On the other side of the mem-
brane, cold permeate ows. The temperature difference between the
membrane surfaces creates a difference of vapor pressure across the
membrane that causes feed vapor permeate through membrane pores,
and condense on the cold permeate side.

2.2. Heat transfer

Referring to DCMD conguration in Fig. 1, different modes of heat
transfer are identied. In the feed side, uid is at high temperature,
high salinity owing over the membrane surface. The heat transfer in
this side will be due to convection. Then on the permeate side the
uid is owing, causing convective heat transfer to occur. Through the
membrane, the heat transfer is due conduction and mass ux. Thus,
heat transfer in a DCMD module is occurring in three regions.
(1) Convective heat transfer (Q, W/m2) from the feed stream to
membrane surface, governed by Newton's law of cooling [18,
24,30],

tions depending on the ow type (laminar or turbulent).

(2) Heat transfer through membrane material by conduction and
through the pores by evaporative mass ux.

product of vapor mass ux (Jw) and enthalpy of vaporization (¶§Hv);

The values of these temperatures can be inserted back in Eqs. (2) and
(3) to determine the vapor pressures and then calculate the ux from
Eqs. (1) or (4).
To account for the effect of feed concentration on permeate ux, we
dene the concentration polarization coefcient as the ratio of salt con-
centration at the membrane surface to the concentration of salt in the
feed stream [24],

3. Experimental setup

The DCMD module consists of a at-sheet membrane and a
channeled MD module. The module is made up of two Plexiglas ow
compartments [39]. Fig. 2a shows the module assembly where the
membrane is sandwiched between the two ow compartments. Each
ow compartment has dimensions of 160 mm long, 160 mm wide,
and 25 mm thick as shown in Fig. 2b. One compartment is used for
hot feed water; while the other compartment is used for permeate
cold water. Water enters through header and distributed into three
channels. After passing over the membrane surface, the uid is collected
back into the exit header. Each ow compartment has three rectangular
channel of the same dimensions of 66 mm in length, 24 mm in width
and 5 mm in depth. A feed spacer, in the form of a mesh (net), is used
between the feed stream and active side of membrane surface, as
shown in Fig. 2c. The purpose of this spacer is to mechanically support
the membrane in addition to enhance the turbulence level in the feed
channel for better permeation ux. To avoid internal leakage, a rubber
sheet of 2 mm thickness is used as a gasket.
Internal leakage may happen because of membrane rupture at sharp
edges during the module assembly. The assembled module is shown in
Fig. 2d. The effective membrane area of permeation is 6.192E  2 m2.

Insulated steel pipes are used for inlet and outlet uid transmission
from heater and chiller. The water heater and chiller operate by con-
trolled thermostat head (acquired from ThermoFisher), and are used
to provide constant ow rates and constant temperatures for the feed
and coolant streams. A oat ow meter is used to measure feed ow
rate and a turbine ow meter is used to measure coolant ow rate.
The feed and the permeate concentrations are measured using a cali-
brated conductivity meter. Pressure gauges (max range of 2 bar) are
used to measure and observe the inlet and outlet pressure of feed and
permeate sides. Hi-Speed USB Carrier (National Instruments) is used
for data acquisition. K-type thermocouples are used to monitor the
inlet and outlet temperature of feed and permeate sides. The extra per-
meate is collected from the chiller tank with time via a tube at its top.
Fig. 3 shows a real photo of the instrumented DCMD module and a sche-
matic of the experimental setup.
In the experimental work, four levels of feed concentrations are test-
ed: (1) Sweet tap water having concentration of 0.140 g/L, (2) Aqueous
salt NaCl solution of 2 g/L, (3) Seawater collected from Arabian Gulf, Al-
Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 43 g/L salt concentration (with-
out any pre-treatment), and (4) Extreme lab NaCl-water salt solution
of 100 g/L.

4. Results and discussion

The current investigation aimed to present a comprehensive exper-
imental and analytical study on the variables that affect the perfor-
mance of the DCMD system. In this section, the feed temperature is
varied from 40 to 90 °„C. The cold permeate temperature is varied from
5 °„C to 25 °„C. The feed ow rate and coolant ow rate are tested at
three different levels. Different concentrations of the feed water of
0.14, 2, 43 and 100 g/L are examined. PTFE membranes having two dif-
ferent mean pore sizes of 0.45 ¶Ãm and 0.22 ¶Ãm are used.

4.1. Effect of feed and permeate temperatures

The effects of feed temperature on the permeate ux are studied
over a range of temperatures from 40 °„C to 90 °„C with an increment of
10 °„C. The ux change with feed temperature was observed at varying

cold permeate temperatures of 5 °„C, 10 °„C, 15 °„C, 20 °„C, and 25 °„C; re-
spectively, with feed concentration of 2 g/L. Experimental and theoreti-
cal results are shown in Fig. 4(a) to (e) as separate sub-gures to avoid
data clustering and to shed more light on the validation of the theoret-
ical model. Increasing the feed temperature increases the permeate ux,

almost in an exponential way in agreement with Antoine Eq. (2). Ac-
cording to this equation, the effect of temperature on vapor pressure
is small at low feed temperature, and becomes very signicant at high
feed temperature. The maximum permeate ux achieved at feed tem-
perature of 90 °„C and cold permeate temperature of 5 °„C is about 100
kg/m2°§h. This high value of permeate ux is attributed to the high tem-
perature difference across the membrane, the high porosity of the PTFE
membrane, high contact angle, and large pore size. Increasing the tem-
perature difference across the membrane increases the vapor pressure
difference between the membrane sides. However, the thermal bound-
ary layer increases and consequently the temperature polarization over
the membrane.
The theoretical model predictions of the permeate ux are in good
agreement with the experimentally measured values at different tem-
peratures. Maximum deviations between calculated and measured
uxes are found at the lowest permeate temperature of 5 °„C. The effect
of cold permeate temperature on ux is shown Fig. 5, where the perme-
ate temperature is varied from 5 °„C to 25 °„C by an increment of 5 °„C, at
selected feed temperatures. The ux increases as the cold permeate
temperature decreases. Decreasing the permeate temperature increases
the transmembrane vapor pressure difference; which leads to increas-
ing the permeate ux. The model prediction of ux shows good agree-
ment with the measured values.

In order to assess the effects of operating the DCMD system at differ-
ent temperatures, the percent change in measured ux is displayed in
Fig. 6. Comparatively, from Fig. 6 (a) and (b), increasing the feed stream
temperature is more effective in increasing the system ux as compared
to decreasing the cold permeate stream temperature. Referring to
Fig. 6a, the percentage increase in ux is reported at the corresponding
feed temperatures when the cold permeate temperature is reduced
from 25 °„C to 5 °„C. This plot enables us to monitor and justify the effec-
tiveness of cooling the permeate stream down to 5 °„C, which consumes
a lot of energy, compared to the use of near room temperature permeate
stream. In general, reducing the temperature of the cold permeate
stream improves the system ux at any given feed temperature. One
can report about 35% increase in ux, on average, when reducing per-
meate temperature from 25 °„C to 5 °„C, except for feed temperature of
40 °„C where the ux increase is signicant (114%). Percentagewise, op-
erating at lower permeate temperature is more effective in increasing
the ux at low feed temperatures. On the other hand, Fig.6b shows
the percentage increase in ux when the feed temperature increases
from 50 to 90 °„C, at a given temperature of the cold permeate stream.
Increasing the feed temperature from 50 to 90 °„C increases the ux by
302 to 560%, depending on the temperature of cold permeate stream.
However, the percentage increase in ux increases with increasing the
cold permeate temperature. It may be understood that although operat-
ing the DCMD system at low permeate temperature can yield higher
values of ux, the percentage increase in ux is larger at high permeate
temperature, for the same range of increased feed temperature.
Since the operating temperatures for feed (Tf) and cold permeate
(Tc) are the most affecting parameters on the DCMD system perfor-
mance, Figs. 7 and 8 show, experimentally and theoretically, the effects
of the temperature difference and temperature ratio between the hot
feed and cold permeate streams; respectively. The operating conditions
are; PTFE membrane with pore size of 0.45 ¶Ãm, feed ow rate 4.65 L/
min, cold permeate ow rate of 3.65 L/min. The feed is seawater with

concentration of 43 g/L. The plots are produced for different selected
cold permeate temperatures of 5, 15, and 25 °„C.
From Figs. 7 and 8, good agreements are observed between theoret-
ical and experimental values of ux at different operating combinations
of feed and cold permeate temperatures differences and ratios. These
good agreements attest the reliability of the analytical model to predict
the system ux under different conditions. Of course, increasing the
temperature difference increases the ux as shown in Fig. 7. However,
at a given temperature difference, higher cold permeate temperature
yields higher ux. This behavior may be attributed to the large conduc-
tion heat loss across the membrane and from the module itself to the
surroundings at lower temperature of the cold permeate stream. From
Fig. 8, when the temperature ratio increases, the ux increase exponen-
tially and the variation trends have different slopes corresponding to
different temperatures of the cold permeate. The curves slopes tend to
decrease as the cold permeate temperature decreases from 25 °„C to
5 °„C. It is interesting to know that in order to produce 60 kg/m2°§h of dis-
tillate, for example from Fig. 8, one needs to set the feed temperature at
80 °„C if the cold side temperature is 25 °„C, 70 °„C if the cold side is at
15 °„C, and 64 °„C if the cold side is at 5 °„C. One may conclude that utilizing
energy for heating the feed side water is more efcient (produces more
ux) than utilizing the same amount of energy for cooling the cold
stream. More specically, use energy for heating while using room tem-
perature water for the cold permeate stream.

4.2. Effect of feed and cold permeate ow rates

When the ow rate increases the channel ow Reynolds number in-
creases, and hence the turbulence level. The direct outcome is to en-
hance the mixing in the boundary layer adjacent to the membrane
surface leading to higher heat and mass transfer coefcients. In DCMD
modules, both feed and permeate streams are in direct contact with
the membrane and thus the ow rates on both membrane sides are ex-
pected to be effective on permeation process. Fig. 9 shows the effect of
feed ow rate on the system permeate ux. The increase in ux is prom-
inent with increasing the feed ow rate. For instant, at feed temperature
of 90 °„C, permeate ux increases from 55 to 72 kg/m2°§h, by increasing
the ow rate from 2.5 to 4.6 L/min, which is about 31% increase. The cor-
responding percentage increase in ux, for the same change in feed ow
rate, at feed temperatures of 50 °„C and 70 °„C is found to be about 28%. If
one looks from the feed temperature point of view, increasing the feed
temperature from 50 °„C to 90 °„C yields about 260% increase in ux at
feed ow rate of 2.5 L/min and about 290% at feed ow rate of 4.6 L/
min. This result indicates that increasing the feed ow rate is more ef-
fective in improving the ux at higher feed temperatures in particular.
The channel ow Reynolds number in feed side was found to be turbu-
lent (N 2300) for the considered conditions of feed ow rate and tem-
perature. On the other hand, increasing the turbulence level reduces
the residence time of the feed water in the feed channel. The effect of

Cold permeate Flow rate (L/min)

residence time on permeate ux is implanted in the ow rate and turbu-
lence effects and needs more investigations in future.
Fig. 10 shows that permeate ux increases with increasing the ow
rate of the cold permeate stream, at selected different feed tempera-
tures of 50, 70, and 90 °„C. Increasing the coolant ow rate from 2 to
3.65 L/min (laminar channel ow, Re b 2300 for all tested cases) result-
ed in only 4.6% increase in permeate ux at feed temperature of 90 °„C
and this percentage increases to 11% for feed temperature of 50 °„C. In-
creasing the cold permeate ow rate is less effective on the permeate
ux as compared to the effect of increasing the feed ow rate. The
feed side is always more effective on the permeate ux since it is the
source vaporization and controlling the permeation process.
Fig. 11 shows the effect of the ratio between feed ow rate and cold
permeate ow rate (Vf/Vp) on ux both experimentally and theoretical-
ly, for selected permeate ow rates (namely, Vp = 2, 2.9 and 3.65 L/
min). The test conditions are: PTFE 0.45 ¶Ãm membrane, inlet feed tem-
perature of 90 °„C, inlet permeate temperature of 25 °„C, feed concentra-
tion of 43 g/L, and the feed ow rate is varied from 2.5 L/min to 4.65 L/
min. It is observed that increasing the ow ratio (Vf/Vp) increases the
ux at any cold permeate ow rate in a parabolic manner. For a given
ratio, higher permeate ow rate yields considerable increase in ux out-
put. In addition, a good coherence is observed between theoretical
values and experimental values of ux at all permeate ow rate.

4.3. Effect of feed concentration

To study the effect of feed concentration on the ux of the DCMD
system, four levels of feed concentrations are tested as mentioned
above in Section 3, namely 0.14, 2, 43, and 100 g/L. these values were se-
lected to cover a wide range of feed concentrations from very low to
very high values including the seawater of 43 g/L. The test conditions
are: feed ow rate 4.65 L/min, coolant ow rate 3.65 L/min, and cold
permeate temperature of 25 °„C. Fig. 12 shows that the permeate ux
is continuously decreasing as the feed salinity increases. The ux

reduction with increasing the feed concentration is mainly due to the
increasing effect of the salt concentration polarization, which adds
more resistance to vapor permeation across the membrane. In addition,
scaling and fouling on the membrane surface due to salts and impurities
tend to cover some effective area of membrane that retards the evapo-
ration process and reduces the vapor pressure difference across the
membrane, so ultimately the ux decreases. Few conclusions may be
extracted from Fig. 12: The decrease in ux follows linear decreasing
trend with increasing the feed concentration. The DCMD system is
able to handle feed solutions with high concentration of 100 g/L,
which attests its ability to desalinate brine solutions of high concentra-
tion, like oileld produced water for example, as mentioned by [11]. In
calculating the percentage reduction in ux when increasing the feed
concentration from 0.14 to 100 g/L, about 50% reduction in ux at feed
temperature of 50 °„C, 22% reduction at 70 °„C, and 17.5% reduction at
90 °„C is achieved. Therefore, it is obvious that the effect of feed concen-
tration is becoming less signicant at high feed temperature as com-
pared to operating at low feed temperature.
Salt rejection factor (SRF) is a measure of the quality of the ux and
the efciency of separation process. It is dened as;

SRF  Feed ConcentrationPermeate Concentration

Fig. 13 shows the SRF values for different feed concentrations at dif-
ferent feed temperatures. Four levels of feed concentrations, 0.140, 2, 43
and 100 g/L are tested. For low feed concentration of 0.14 g/L, the salt re-
jection factor was 97.8%. As the feed concentration increases from 0.14
to 2 g/L, the SRF increased to 99.15%. When seawater (43 g/L) and the
extreme concentration NaCl solution of 100 g/L are used as feed, the
salt rejection factor was 99.96%. These high values of the SRF indicate

4.4. Effect of membrane pore size and degradation

The MD separation performance is directly associated with the over-
all membrane morphology, which is considered the most important
component of the MD process. Therefore, the successful application of
MD may be aided by a good knowledge of the different membrane pa-
rameters. Two polytetrauoroethylene (PTFE) membranes, acquired
from Tisch Scientic Corporation, with different pore sizes were used
in the present study, namely PTFE SF17385 and SF17386 membranes
with mean pore sizes of 0.22 ¶Ãm and 0.45 ¶Ãm; respectively as reported
by the manufacturer. It is worth noting that PTFE membrane is com-
posed of two layers, a thin active layer and a support layer. The charac-
terization of the two membranes used in the present work was carried
out in our labs and the measured values are listed in Table 1. The mea-
sured properties included the actual overall thickness (¶ƒmembrane), the
active layer thickness (¶ƒactive), the mean pore size (dp), the porosity
(¶≈), the water contact angle (¶»), and the liquid water entry pressure
(LEP). More details on membrane characterization can be found in
Khalifa et al. [41].
Fig. 14 shows SEM micrographs of top (active) surface taken from
both PTFE (0.22 ¶Ãm) and PTFE (0.45 ¶Ãm) membranes, while Fig. 15 dis-
plays SEM micrographs of their respective cross sections. The active
layer of both membranes is of about the same thickness, as well as
their overall thickness. Moreover, they also display similar values of
the porosity and degree of hydrophobicity, rendering the comparison
useful with respect to their ux performance. It is worth indicating
that according to our measurements, the PTFE (0.45 ¶Ãm) membrane ex-
hibits an overall lower average pore size than that reported by the sup-
plier that is roughly 0.38 ¶Ãm (measured) compared to 0.45 ¶Ãm
(reported). As expected, the LEP of PTFE (0.22 ¶Ãm) membrane is slightly
higher than that of PTFE (0.45 ¶Ãm).
Membrane pore size is an important property of the membrane
morphology. Bigger pore size means less resistance to mass transfer
and hence higher driving force for permeation across the membrane.
Fig. 16 shows that the PTFE (0.45 ¶Ãm) membrane produces a relatively
higher ux compared to PTFE (0.22 ¶Ãm) membrane. Regarding the ef-
fect of feed temperature (40 to 90 °„C) on the percentage ux increase
between the two membranes, there is an average of 7 to 9% ux in-
crease, except for a jump of 20% ux increase at 80 °„C. This indicates a
general consistent percentage ux increase for the larger pore size at
different feed temperatures. Another important note from Fig. 16 is
that almost doubling the membrane pore size does not lead to doubling
the ux, indicating the nonlinearity behavior between the ux and pore
size. As mentioned earlier, both membranes have similar active layer
and overall thicknesses, close values of the porosity, and similar degrees
of hydrophobicity. Usually, the pore size of commercial membranes is
not exceeding 1 ¶Ãm. For pore sizes N 1 ¶Ãm, surface energy of membrane
materials decreases, and hydrophobicity decreases, leading to pore wet-
ting phenomenon and hence deteriorating the MD process performance
[27]. The theoretical model results indicate a consistent ux

enhancement when using larger pore size for the whole range of feed
temperatures and agree well with the experimental results.
A continuous 48-h experiment was conducted to investigate the ef-
fect of continuous operation of the system on permeate ux and mem-
brane degradation. Fig. 17 shows the variation in permeate ux with
time over the 48 h. The experiment was performed using the PTFE
0.45 membrane, with two types of feed water of different concentra-
tions, namely sweet tap water (0.14 g/L) and seawater (43 g/L). Feed
ow rate is set at 3.75 L/min and cold permeate ow rate at 3.65 L/
min. For the tap water, the maximum ux is obtained at the start of
the experiment, followed by a noticeable decrease in ux after 3 h,

thereafter remaining almost constant for the rest of the test period
with minor perturbations. In general, about 15% reduction in ux was
recorded over the 48 h period. On the other hand, the use of seawater
as feed gave different results. First, as expected, the seawater ux is
lower than that of tap water due to its higher concentration. Second, a
sharp and continuous reduction in ux was recorded after 20 h, yielding
an average percentage reduction in ux after of 42% after 48 h. This large
reduction in ux with time for seawater can be attributed to the effect of
salt precipitation and fouling on the membrane surface, in addition to

the concentration polarization. Indeed, the membrane degradation after
the 48 h continuous ow operation is clearly visible in Fig. 18b which
displays the SEM image of the used PTFE (0.45 ¶Ãm) membrane covered
with a fouling layer, as compared to the as-received membrane shown
in Fig. 18a. According to the ux results shown in Fig. 17, the fouling
layer may have started its formation (most probably covering a large
portion of the membrane surface) after about 20 h ow test operation
due to the noticeable decrease in the ux. Longer testing led to further
membrane degradation resulting in almost 50% ux decrease after
48 h. Longer testing data are not available.

water, at the beginning of the experiment the salt rejection factor is al-

rejection factor decreased in the rst few hours, remained constant for
another 6 h, and repeated the same behavior as time advances. The
change in the salt rejection factor in this case was 3.4%. For seawater,
salt rejection factor started at 99.98% and became 99.956% at the end
of the experiment, which is only 0.04% change in the rejection factor
over 48 h. Fig. 19 proves the consistency of DCMD conguration for sea-
water desalination. One may question the higher rejection factor for
seawater compared to sweet tap water. It should be mentioned that
the TDS of distillate water, used in the permeate side to start the exper-
iment, is not exactly zero; it was measured to be about 2 to 3 mg/L. With
operation, The TDS of the permeate side increases slightly with time; as
shown in Fig. 19b. The permeate TDS for tap water may be considered
constant in the range of 4 to 5 mg/L over the 48 h. On the other hand,
the permeate TDS of seawater feed changed from 7 mg/L at the begin-
ning of the experiment to 20 mg/L after 48 h. However, the TDS of
feed seawater (43,000 mg/L) is very high compared to the TDS of tap
water (140 mg/L) and the ratio in the denition of the salt rejection fac-
tor presented in Eq. (37) yields the results shown in Fig. 19a.

4.5. Energy analysis

The evaporative (thermal) efciency, EE, is dened as the ratio of
evaporative heat transfer to the total heat transferred to the membrane
(or through MD module) and is be given as [40,41]

From Fig. 20, the evaporative efciency ranged from 70% to 95% cor-
responding to feed temperature from 40 °„C to 90 °„C. Increasing the inlet
feed temperature increases the evaporative efciency due to ux in-
creasing. Another interesting behavior shown in Fig. 20 is that the evap-
orative efciency is higher at higher cold permeate temperature, for a
given feed temperature. In terms of percentage change it can be ob-
served that at 40 °„C, the increase in evaporative efciency is 12.63%
when the bulk coolant (permeate) temperature, Tbc, is changed from
5 °„C to 25 °„C. However, as the inlet feed temperature increases, the dif-
ferences in the efciency values diminish, and at 90 °„C, it is 2% only.
Thus, when operating the DCMD system at higher feed temperature,
the effect of inlet coolant temperature on the efciency is not signicant.
However, if the system is running at low inlet feed temperature then
higher inlet coolant temperature is preferred for higher evaporative
efciency.
The gain output ratio (GOR) is another performance measure that is
used extensively in thermal desalination to assess the thermal process
energy efciency. The MD technique is mainly thermal (evaporation

in the feed side and condensation in the permeate/cold side) and the
permeation is mainly due to the applied temperature difference across
the membrane. Thus, GOR denition can be applied to MD systems
[43,44]. The GOR value may be of interest with MD practically to com-
pare its progress with other common desalination techniques like ther-
mal ones. The GOR denition is even used with the RO system which is
not thermal in nature, when combined with MD system, [45]. It is de-
ned as the ratio of latent heat of vaporization of the distillate produced
to the heat input to the system with the feed stream [39,42®C45];

Fig. 21 shows the variation of the GOR value with inlet feed temper-
ature, at different cold permeate temperatures of 5, 15 and 25 °„C. The
GOR calculated values increases with increasing the inlet feed tempera-
ture up to 60 °„C then decreases with increasing feed inlet temperature
up to 90 °„C. Experiments shows that working at higher cold permeate
temperature results in higher values of GOR than operating at lower
cold permeate temperatures. In addition, the temperature difference
between inlet and outlet of hot side of module, ¶§Tmodule, is increasing
exponentially as the feed temperature increases, resulting in lower
GOR values. The GOR values were between 0.8 and 1.2 for the tested
range of feed temperature, for the used DCMD system.

A comprehensive study of the performance of the DCMD system was
presented. Details of the experimental setup and the DCMD module de-
sign and assembly were provided. Main variables affecting the system
performance and degradation were discussed both experimentally
and analytically. The membranes used in the study were characterized
and the effects of long-term operation on the membrane surface and
system performance were studied. The analytical model is based on
solving the equations of heat and mass transfer with the DCMD module.
The developed model has proven its ability to predict the system perfor-
mance at different operating conditions with maximum deviations of
b 10% from experimental measurements. The investigated variables in-
cluded feed temperature, cold permeate temperature, feed-permeate
temperature difference and ratio, feed ow rate, permeate ow rate,
feed-permeate ow rate ratio, feed concentration, membrane pore
size, and membrane degradation with time. Permeate ux increases, al-
most exponentially, as the feed temperature increases. Nevertheless, it
increases almost linearly as the permeate temperature decreases. The
effect of decreasing the permeate temperature is smaller than the effect
of increasing the feed temperature. This indicates that the system is bet-
ter operated at high feed temperatures while saving the cooling energy
by running the permeate at ambient temperature. The permeate ux
also increases with the ow rate of both feed and permeate. High ow
rates generate more turbulence thus enhancing the heat and mass
transfer. The effects of feed ow rate are more notable at high feed tem-
perature. The DCMD system is able to handle feeds with high salt con-
centration of 100 g/L with remarkably high salt rejection factor and
low permeate TDS. However, the recorded ux reduction was between
17 and 50% depending on the feed temperature, showing that operating
at high feed temperature results in less reduction in ux when using
high feed concentration. An average of about 8% increase in ux was ob-
tained when the pore size of the PTFE membrane was increased from
0.22 to 0.45 ¶Ãm. The SEM micrographs revealed that the used PTFE
membrane being covered with a fouling layer, as compared to the as-re-
ceived (new) membrane, and the fouling phenomena may have started
its formation after about 20 h ow test operation as indicated by the no-
ticeable decrease in the ux. The evaporative efciency ranged from
70% to 95% corresponding to feed temperature from 40 °„C to 90 °„C
and the calculated GOR values were between 0.8 and 1.2 for the same
range of feed temperature.
