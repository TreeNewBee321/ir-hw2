abstract

This paper introduces a new optimization model for the single and multiple-effect evaporation (SEE/MEE) sys-
tems design, including vapor recompression cycle and thermal integration. The SEE/MEE model is specially de-
veloped for shale gas owback water desalination. A superstructure is proposed to solve the problem,
comprising several evaporation effects coupled with intermediate ashing tanks that are used to enhance ther-
mal integration by recovering condensate vapor. Multistage equipment with intercooling is used to compress the
vapor formed by ashing and evaporation. The compression cycle is driven by electricity to operate on the vapor
originating from the SEE/MEE system, providing all the energy needed in the process. The mathematical model is
formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem optimized under GAMS software by minimizing the total
annualized cost. The SEE/MEE system application for zero liquid discharge (ZLD) is investigated by allowing brine
salinity discharge near to salt saturation conditions. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the
optimal process conguration and performance under distinct feed water salinity conditions. The results high-
light the potential of the proposed model to cost-effectively optimize SEE/MEE systems by producing fresh
water and reducing brine discharges and associated environmental impacts.

1. Introduction

Natural gas extracted from tight shale formations or ※shale gas§, is
expected to play an important role in meeting the rising global energy
demand. In the U.S., it is estimated that natural gas production from
shale deposits will increase from 35% in 2012 to 50% in 2035 [1,2].
This prediction is supported by the rapid progress achieved in recent
years in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology, which
has enhanced technically and economically the exploration of extensive
shale formations around North America [3每5]. In fact, the current ad-
vances in shale gas production have signicantly altered the worldwide
energy scenario for any foreseeable future [6,7]. In Europe, shale gas ex-
ploration has emerged as an attractive energy source mainly due its
supply reliability. Contrarily to petroleum-based energy sources, natural
gas production from unconventional reservoirs like shale deposits does
not depend of unstable foreign markets that often dictate elevated
prices.
Natural gas production from shale formations requires well stimula-
tion for starting and maintaining the process, due to the low gas perme-
ability on the rock [8,9]. Hence, the wells must be drilled and fractured
to retrieve the tight gas trapped in the shale rock formations. For this
reason, shale gas production consists of an unconventional gas drilling
technology that requires large amounts of water for hydraulic fracturing
of each well [10]. The fracturing uids are injected into the horizontal
well under high pressure creating a complex articial fracture network
to promote gas exhaustion. Usually, six or more wells are drilled hori-
zontally through an extension of up to 2000 m, with a fracture network
depth that can reach 500 m into the shale formation [11].
Actually, the development of technologies for drilling and hydro
fracturing of shale gas plays are strongly conditioned by the water avail-
ability and owback water disposal [5,12]. Recent studies estimate that
the hydraulic fracturing of one single horizontal well demands approx-
imately 3每6 million gallons of water (10,500每21,500 m3) [13,14]. The
hydraulic fracturing uid is predominantly composed by water and
sand ( 98%) containing several chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors,
surfactants, friction reducers, acids, ow improvers [3]. Approximately
10每80% of the amount of injected uid ows back to surface during
the rst two weeks from the beginning of well exploitation [11,15].
Along with the chemical additives utilized for fracturing the wells,
owback water also contains high concentrations of salts and other
minerals. Table 1 presents average and maximum values achieved for
the owback water salinity from important U.S. shale plays, expressed
in terms of the total dissolved solids (TDS). The owback water can be
recovered for recycling as injection water or for other purposes, de-
manding specic treatment before any disposal and/or reuse.
Several works have been dedicated to the design and operation of
shale gas supply chains for optimal water management [1,4,16每19].
Other studies have focused on the minimization of water consumption
[5,13] and gaseous emissions [3,20] during shale gas production. How-
ever, available literature about the treatment of high-salinity owback
water is scarce. It is worth noting that the water produced from shale
gas drilling and fracturing can represent a serious environmental prob-
lem, due to high concentrations of TDS and other pollutants.
The great potential of shale gas production at global scale highlights
the need to develop more cost-effective processes for the treatment of
the shale gas owback water. Shaffer et al. [21] have critically reviewed
promising technologies for desalination of high-salinity produced water
from shale gas exploration. According to the authors, mechanical vapor
recompression (MVR) systems are often more advantageous than
membrane-based technologies for water desalination [22]. MVR sys-
tems require less extensive pretreatment processes because they are
usually less susceptible to fouling problems caused by the presence of
grease and oil.
There are several publications addressing the optimization problem
of multiple-effect evaporation (MEE) systems. The rst references in the
eld date from 1840, with the MEE system being one of the oldest and
most widely used water desalination process around the globe [23].
Halil and Sylemez [24] have developed a mathematical modeling ap-
proach for the design and simulation of MEE processes for seawater de-
salination, considering forward feed conguration and renewable
energy sources. Gautami and Khanam [25] have proposed nonlinear
programming (NLP) models for MEE synthesis and optimization. The
optimal design conguration is chosen according to the steam economy
in the process. In the work of Druetta et al. [26], a nonlinear mathemat-
ical model based on energy and mass balances is presented to predict

the optimal MEE performance in terms of energy efciency. The MEE
model is successfully applied to seawater desalination, and the sensitiv-
ity analysis and simulations show good accuracy with realistic designs.
Posteriorly, the model has been extended in Druetta et al. [27] to deter-
mine the equipment capacity and operational conditions by considering
the minimization of process costs as the objective function. Al-Mutaz
and Wazeer [28] have proposed mathematical models to evaluate the
performance of distinct congurations of conventional MEE systems, in-
cluding forward, backward and parallel/cross feed. More recently, Al-
Mutaz [23] has published a comparative study on different seawater de-
salination plants. His work indicates power consumption efciency as
the main feature for making the MEE process more attractive than the
dominant multistage ash (MSF) [29每32] and reverse osmosis (RO)
[33每38] desalination processes. Piacentino [39] has introduced an in-
depth cost analysis for multiple-effect distillation plants, through the
calculation of exergetic efciency at subcomponent levels. His study in-
troduces some key considerations when developing thermo-economi-
cal models.
EI-Dessouky et al. [32,40每44] have made important contributions in
mathematical modeling and design of MEE systems with/without me-
chanical (MVR) or thermal vapor recompression (TVR). In EI-Dessouky
et al. [40], different models are presented for MEE systems design in-
cluding MVR and TVR for seawater desalination. Mathematical models
for optimizing single-effect evaporation (SEE) systems with mechanical
vapor recompression can be found in several studies in the literature
[44每52]. Al-Juwayhel [45] have developed a comprehensive design
model for the design of SEE including MVR process. The model has pos-
teriorly been expanded by Ettouney [44] for determining the geometri-
cal characteristics of the evaporator, in addition to the heat transfer area
and power consumption calculations. The optimization of SEE systems
with MVR using mathematical programming has also been studied by
Mussati et al., [53] considering several non-convex constraints. Never-
theless, it should be underlined that all of the above-mentioned works
were applied only to seawater desalination. Therefore, in previous stud-
ies no considerations have been made about the treatment of very con-
centrated feed and achievement of zero liquid discharge (ZLD) of brine.
ZLD systems have been studied by Thu et al. [54], by considering an
advanced multiple-effect adsorption process. The desalination process
is developed to efciently deal with high-salinity feed water, including
brine from other seawater desalination plants. Chung et al. [55] have
also investigated ZLD application for the desalination of highly concen-
trated water by allowing brine discharge close to NaCl saturation condi-
tions. In their work, an approach based on nite differences is used to
numerically simulate a multistage membrane distillation process. Al-
though the process can represent an attractive alternative over usual
thermal desalination systems due to scale facility, by analyzing
exergetic and energetic process efciencies, the authors have concluded
that the required specic membrane area will determine its economic
viability.
To surpass the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a new
mathematical programming model for optimizing single and multiple-
effect evaporation (SEE/MEE) systems, including vapor recompression
cycle and thermal integration. The SEE/MEE process is conceived for
the treatment of high-salinity owback water originated during shale
gas hydraulic fracturing process. The main objective of the proposed
SEE/MEE system is to produce fresh water and concentrated saline
close to ZLD, considering the outow brine salinity near to salt satura-
tion conditions. For this purpose, the multiple-effect superstructure for
owback water desalination includes as many evaporation effects as
there are ashing tanks, placed intermittently. As a result, process ener-
gy efciency is further enhanced by recuperating the condensate vapor.
The evaporation system is designed with a counter-current ow cong-
uration. Thus, concentrated brine is recovered in the rst evaporator ef-
fect, while feed water is added to the last one after preheating. In
addition, the vapor formed by evaporation and condensate ashing is
compressed through multistage electric-driven mechanical equipment

232

containing intercoolers. Consequently, the SEE/MEE process does not
require any other external energy source.
The superstructure is mathematically formulated as an NLP
model solved using GAMS, minimizing the total annualized cost of the
process. The SEE and MEE optimal congurations including vapor
recompression cycle and heat integration are compared in terms of
their ability to achieve ZLD conditions for the brine concentrate. Sensi-
tivity analysis is performed to assess the optimal evaporation process
conguration and performance under different owback water salin-
ities. In addition, the obtained results are validated by simulations
using Aspen HYSYS software.
The main novelties introduced by this work include: (i) develop-
ment of a more comprehensive and robust NLP model for the optimal
simultaneous synthesis of SEE/MEE systems,
including vapor
recompression cycle and thermal integration; (ii) application of the pro-
posed SEE/MEE model to the treatment of high-salinity owback water,
originating from the hydraulic fracturing process in shale gas produc-
tion; (iii) SEE/MEE model application to ZLD conditions of the concen-
trated brine and the high recovery ratio of fresh water; (iv) capability
of the SEE/MEE model to effectively deal with very high concentrations
of the feed water; and, (v) facility of process scaling.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the formal
problem statement, wherein the study boundaries are dened and the
major process features are described in detail. In Section 3, we develop
the mathematical NLP model for the simultaneous SEE/MEE synthesis.
The capabilities of our developed SEE/MEE model are evaluated in
Section 4, by applying it to a case study based on shale gas production.
In addition, this section shows the main results and discussions about
the sensitivity analysis and HYSYS simulations, and the most important
computational aspects. Finally, the conclusions of the work are present-
ed in Section 5.

2. Problem statement

Given is a high-salinity owback water stream from shale gas pro-
duction, with a known supply state (inlet mass owrate, salinity, tem-
perature and pressure) and target specication dened by the brine
concentration. Additionally, equipment (for promoting heat exchange,
evaporation, compression and separation) and energy services (includ-
ing cooling water and electric power) are also provided, with their re-
spective costs. The goal is to identify the optimal SEE/MEE system
conguration, considering the vapor recompression cycle and thermal
integration, by minimizing the process total annualized cost. The opti-
mal process conguration should achieve a high recovery ratio of
fresh water produced and brine close to the ZLD condition. The objective
function is composed of the capital cost of investment in equipment and
the operating expenses related to cold utility and electricity.
It should be highlighted that improving the process cost-effective-
ness through the reduction of brine discharges (i.e., achieving ZLD con-
ditions and consequently, increasing the fresh water production),
allows lessening the environmental impacts associated to energy con-
sumption and waste disposal. Shale gas exploration is a recent technol-
ogy that requires further development, particularly in the framework of
the owback water treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
rst work proposing the ZLD application to the treatment of the
owback water from shale gas fracking, through a SEE/MEE system in-
cluding MVR and thermal integration. The multiple-effect superstruc-
ture proposed for the desalination of shale gas owback water is
showed in Fig. 1.
The following equipment are considered in the MEE system with
vapor recompression and thermal integration:

(i) Shell-and-tube preheater (for the heat exchange between feed
water and condensate).
(ii) Multiple-effect evaporator.
(iii) Multistage electricity-driven compressor with intercoolers.

(iv) Flashing tanks.
(v) Pumps and mixers.

The MEE system comprises i evaporation effects intermediately
coupled to ashing tanks that are used to recover condensate vapor, en-
hancing process energy efciency. Note that the SEE system corre-
sponds to a simplication of the MEE process, being composed of a
single-effect evaporator without a ash tank. In this case, vapor ashing
is not allowed due to the low amount of recoverable energy from the
condensate, which makes unfeasible the capital cost related to the allo-
cation of such equipment.
In the proposed MEE system, the evaporation effects are numbered
according to the direction of the heat ow (i.e., from 1 to i). The evapo-
rator effect i is composed of the shell containing droplet separator (to
remove water from the saturated vapor), spaces for the saturated
vapor and saline pool, brine spray nozzles and evaporation/condensa-
tion tubes. A counter-current ow conguration is considered such
that the vapor from the last evaporation effect and the condensate
vapor from the last ash tank are compressed, through a mechanical
equipment composed by j stages. Thus, the superheated compressed
vapor is added in the rst evaporation effect, whereas the feed water
(corresponding to the shale gas owback water) is inserted in the last
one. It should be noted that the vapor recompression process is cyclic.
Thus, the entire amount of vapor formed in the last evaporator effect
is routed to the mechanical vapor compressor together with the ashed
off condensate vapor from last ash tank 〞to be superheated to a de-
sired target condition〞 before being added to the rst evaporation ef-
fect. It should be emphasized that the vapor recompression cycle
allows further enhancing heat integration in evaporation systems, be-
cause it operates on all the vapor originated from the evaporation sys-
tem, providing the energy required in the process [56].
Under this system conguration, the rst evaporation effect should
present the highest temperature and pressure, while the last effect i
should be subjected to the lowest conditions for these variables. More-
over, the vapor formed in the system follows the direction of dropping
pressure (and temperature). The brine (feed) ows in the opposite di-
rection. The superheated vapor from compression (for effect 1), as
well as the vapor formed in previous effects (for effects 2 to i), are intro-
duced inside the evaporator tubes. The feed water (i.e., brine from sub-
sequent stages for effects 1 to i-1; and, shale gas owback water in effect
i) is sprayed on the tubes in the shell-side to promote evaporation. In
this way, the vapor is condensed on the tube-side by transferring its la-
tent heat to the falling lm formed by the sprayed feed. Observe that in
the rst effect, the formed falling lm outside tubes absorbs the latent
heat from the compressed vapor starting the process of feed (i.e., brine
from effect 2) evaporation. The vapor formed is used to drive effect 2.
This process occurs successively until last effect i. Still in effect 1, sensi-
ble heat is responsible for the temperature change in the tube-side,
wherein the condensed vapor changes from the inlet superheated
vapor temperature to its desired outlet condition. Note that the conden-
sate outlet temperature should correspond to the inlet vapor saturation
pressure.
After each evaporation effect, the condensed vapor is sent to ash
tanks to reduce its pressure (and temperature) and, consequently, re-
cover energy. The small amount of ashed off condensate vapor in an ef-
fect i, plus the vapor formed by boiling in the previous effect are added
to the tube-side of the subsequent evaporation effect. For this reason,
both streams should be at the same pressure. Before entering into the
evaporator, the feed water is preheated taking in advantage the sensible
heat from the condensed vapor (i.e., produced fresh water) to improve
heat integration in the evaporation system [57]. The increase in the
feed temperature is essential for improving the energy recovery and
maintaining the system productivity in the presence of climatic changes
throughout the year.
The SEE/MEE synthesis with MVR and thermal integration is a
complex process and we seek the optimal system conguration

corresponding to lower heat transfer area and minimum services con-
sumption (including thermal utilities and electricity). For this purpose,
all ows properties (i.e., temperature, pressure, specic enthalpy, con-
centration and owrate) are unknown variables needing optimization.
Fig. 2 (a) shows the main process variables for the effect i of the

evaporator and ash tank i, while Fig. 2 (b) displays the system variables

perature constraints to guarantee the optimal equipment functioning,
allied to the high non-convexity and nonlinearity of the cost correla-
tions further increase the complexity of the model.

For the desalination of the shale gas owback water, it is assumed
that the feed water has been previously treated to remove all contami-
nants, including chemical additives (such as ow improvers, acids, sur-
factants, friction reducers, and corrosion inhibitors), oils, greases and
sand. Water pretreatment technologies can include ltration, chemical
and physical precipitation, sedimentation and otation. However, the
shale gas owback water still has high TDS concentration after pretreat-
ment. The objective of the proposed SEE/MEE system is to supply, in
combination with suitable water pretreatment technologies, high
cost-effective recovery of fresh water for reuse or for safe disposal.
Also, the system should operate at low pressure and temperature to pre-
vent equipment instability and avoid corrosion and fouling problems,
which can be caused by the high salt concentration and the presence
of remaining oils and greases. In addition, the lower operation temper-
atures allow for reducing process scaling and thermodynamic losses,
allowing for minimal thermal insulation [41,43].
Due to the use of an electric-driven mechanical compressor, the SEE/
MEE system does not require an external energy source. An energy gen-
erator can be used when electricity services are not available, making
the SEE/MEE process suitable for use in remote off-grid locations.
Other advantages of the SEE/MEE system include the consideration of
horizontal tube conguration, in which the falling lm formed allows
for higher heat transfer coefcients and lower heat transfer areas [58].
This reduces the capital costs of investment and equipment size, making
the process more compact and therefore more easily transported. More-
over, the MEE system permits the simple inclusion of additional evapo-
ration effects due to its modular feature.
The following assumptions are considered to simplify the mathe-
matical formulation:

(vi) Steady state operation.
(vii) Heat losses in all thermal and mechanical equipment are
neglected.
(viii) The non-equilibrium allowance (NEA) is neglected.
(ix) Pressure drops in all thermal and mechanical equipment are
neglected.
(x) Zero salinity for the condensate (product).
(xi) Vapor streams from each evaporator effect behave as ideal gases.
(xii) All effects of the evaporator are built with nickel (to avoid corro-
sion).
(xiii) The multi-stage compressor is centrifugal (without drivers)
built with carbon steel.
(xiv) Starter energy required for the multi-stage compressor is
neglected.
(xv) Effect of surging and choking is disregarded in the multi-stage
compressor.
(xvi) The vapor multi-stage compression is isentropic.
(xvii) Shell-and-tube preheater and ash tanks are built with carbon
steel.
(xviii) Capital costs of pumps and mixers are negligible.

The mathematical formulation of the proposed model including
equality and inequality constraints for the optimal SEE/MEE process
synthesis is presented in the following section.

3. Mathematical programming model

The mathematical programming model for optimizing SEE/MEE sys-
tems is formulated based on the superstructure presented in Fig. 1. The
proposed superstructure is composed by i evaporation effects coupled
intermediately to i ashing tanks, and j compression stages. The inlet
feed_water), mass owrate (Fin
temperature (Tin
feed_water) and salt concentra-
feed_water) of the feed water (i.e., shale gas owback water) are
tion (Sin
known parameters for the model. The outlet conditions of the produced
fresh water〞including temperature (Tout
fresh_water) and owrate

(Fout

fresh_water)〞are variables that must be optimized by considering
brine salinity specications (Sout
brine). All intermediate streams tempera-
tures (T), pressures (P), specic enthalpies (H), salt concentrations (S)
and mass owrates (F), as well as the system performance characteris-
tics (including compression work W, heat transfer area A and heat ow
Q) are decision variables requiring optimization. The mathematical
model formulation comprises mass and energy balances on all equip-
ment and mixing points, and design constraints involving stream tem-
peratures and pressures to avoid solutions without physical meaning.
The objective function accounts for the total annualized process cost,
which is composed by operational expenses and capital investment.
The resulting NLP-based model is developed in the next sections, in
which the SEE/MEE superstructure is generated according to the follow-
ing steps.

3.1. Sets denition

The following sets are required to develop the NLP model.

Note that the number of evaporation effects and compression stages
can be chosen arbitrarily. However, the selection of larger values for
these indices will increases the problem size and complexity and, conse-
quently, the difculty in obtaining a solution.

3.2. Multiple-effect evaporator

The multiple-effect evaporator design is as follows.

3.2.1. Evaporator mass balances
For effects 1 to i-1, the feed water corresponds to the brine from sub-
sequent effects at Fi+ 1
brine conditions. In the last effect i, the feed
stream is the shale gas owback water to be treated (under Fi
and Sin
feed_water conditions). Thus, the mass balances for the effect i-1 of
the multiple-effect evaporator are given by:

In Eq. (14), Cpvapor is the specic heat for the vapor stream. In this
work, it is considered to be constant in order to simplify the model.
Ti
spv and Ti
condensate are the superheated vapor and condensate tempera-
tures, respectively. The condensate temperature Ti
condensate is estimated
by considering the outlet compressor pressure Pj
spv in Antoine equation
given by Eq. (5). Moreover, Hi
cv and Hi
condensate are the specic enthalpies
for the vapor and liquid phases of the condensate, respectively. These
variables are estimated by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), considering the outlet
condensate temperature Ti
condensate. Note that the salt mass fraction in
Eq. (12) should be equal to zero for the liquid specic enthalpy estima-
tion. The variable Fi

The objective function corresponds to the minimization of the total

recompression and heat recovery. The objective function is dened by
the following mathematical formulation.

3.7.1. Total annualized cost
The total annualized cost of the SEE/MEE system with mechanical
vapor recompression and thermal integration should be equal to the
sum between capital costs (CAPEX) and operational expenses (OPEX)
as described by Eq. (62).

3.7.2. Total capital expenditures
The total capital costs CAPEX should account for the investment cost
of all equipment in the SEE/MEE system with mechanical vapor
recompression and thermal integration. Therefore, the calculation of
the total capital cost includes the expenditures for the preheater, multi-
ple-effect evaporator, multistage compressor and ashing tanks.

In which r is the fractional interest rate per year and y is the number

of a unitary equipment (in kUS$) operating at pressure close to ambient
conditions. CPO is estimated using the correlations presented by Turton
et al. [61] for the preheater and ashing tanks. For the cost estimation of
the evaporator and the multistage compressor, the correlations pro-
posed by Couper et al. [62] are considered. FBM corresponds to the fac-
tor of correction for the basic unitary cost, in which the construction
materials and the operational pressure of these equipment units are
correlated. Moreover, the total annualized cost must be corrected for
the relevant year using the CEPCI index (Chemical Engineering Plant
Cost Index).

4. Case study

A case study is performed to verify the accuracy of the proposed
mathematical model for optimizing SEE/MEE systems, considering
vapor recompression cycle and thermal integration. It should be
highlighted that the problem data used in this example are based on

real data obtained from important U.S. shale plays such as Marcellus
and Barnett [63每66]. The capacity of the centralized treatment plant
should be 900 m3 day 1 (or 10.42 kg s 1) of shale gas owback
water. Interestingly, Lira-Barrag芍n et al. [4] report in a recent work
that under an uncertain scenario as the amount of water required to
complete each well (i.e., considering a standard deviation of 10% in the
shale plays data),
the choice of
the aforementioned value
(900 m3 day 1) has 100% probability of guaranteeing that the plant ca-
pacity is adequate to treat the total amount of owback water. These au-
thors have considered a mean value of 15 k m3 (in a range of 12每
18 k m3) for the amount of water needed for the hydraulic fracturing
of each well, from which 25% is expected to return to surface as
owback water during the rst 3 weeks. Additionally, the total number
of wells to be treated is divided in fracturing crews following an annual
scheduling capable for answering the hydraulic drilling of 20 wells per
year [4].
Typical salinity average values (measured as total dissolved solids -
TDS) for the shale gas owback water from the Marcellus play are re-
ported in the literature in a range of 120每157 k ppm [12,15,63]. Howev-
er, it should be mentioned that other U.S. shale plays can present very
distinct salt concentrations for the owback water as shown in Table
1. For this reason, an initial mean value of 70 k ppm (or 70 g kg 1) is
considered for the feed salinity in the SEE/MEE system design. Never-
theless, it should be noted that the model is robust enough to guarantee
optimal solutions for a large range of salinities and owrates of the
owback water, underlining the facility for process scaling. Model per-
formance and system sensitivity are evaluated under higher salinities
in the next sections. Table 2 presents the problem data, while Fig. 1
shows the general superstructure proposed for the desalination of the
high-salinity owback water from shale gas fracking.
Additional problem data include the minimum pressure and tem-
perature drop between evaporator effects equal to 0.1 kPa and 0.1 ∼C, re-
spectively. Moreover, the minimum temperature approach between the
outlet vapor and concentrated brine, as well as between the superheat-
ed vapor (i.e., vapor after compression) and condensate (fresh water) in
an evaporator effect is 忖Tmin = 2oC. The unknown minimum ideal tem-
perature in the evaporation effect i is considered in a range of 1每100 ∼C
to avoid operational problems (including rusting and fouling), while the
saturated vapor pressure is restricted to 1每200 kPa. Most importantly,
concentrate discharge salinity is specied to be equal to 300 g kg 1
(very close to salt saturation condition of ~ 350 g kg 1) in order to
achieve ZLD operation. In the case study, a factor of annualized capital
cost (fac) of 0.16 is considered; this corresponds to 10% interest rate
over a period of 10 years.

4.1. Optimizing the SEE/MEE system conguration

Several SEE/MEE system congurations are evaluated for their cost-
effectiveness in obtaining concentrated brine at ZLD conditions and
fresh water. In all cases, the minimization of the total annualized cost
of the evaporation process is considered to be the objective function,
which is composed by operational expenses and capital cost of invest-
ment. Initially, the system is optimized considering multiple-effect
evaporation (MEE) without any additional equipment. In this case,
steam at 120 ∼C and 50 kPa provided from an external source
〞Cvapor = 418.8 US$(year kW)坼1〞 is added to the rst evaporation ef-
fect. The counter-current ow conguration is considered: the feed
water (shale gas owback water) is introduced in the last effect of the
evaporator. In this way, the last evaporator effect is submitted to the
lowest pressure and temperature of the system. The optimization of
the MEE process is carried out by varying the number of evaporation ef-
fects. Thus, the optimal conguration obtained consists of 3 evaporator
effects with heat transfer areas (and heat ow) equal to 204.16 m2
(7086.95 kW), 176.91 m2 (6896.88 kW) and 114.27 m2 (6159.42 kW),
respectively. The total annualized cost
(TAC)
is equal
to
3237 k US$ year 1, comprising 2579 k US$ year 1 related to operating
expenses (OPEX) and 658 k US$ year 1 to capital cost of investment
(CAPEX). Note that the evaporator with 2 effects presents a TAC equal
to 4557 k US$ year 1 (OPEX= 4043k US$ year 1 and CAPEX= 514k US$
year 1) while the evaporation equipment with 4 effects has a total cost
of 4812 k US$ year 1 composed by OPEX = 2205k US$ year 1 and
CAPEX = 2607k US$ year 1. Therefore, the operating costs related to
the consumed steam in the process is signicantly reduced as the num-
ber of effects is increased (~ 36% of reduction from 2 to 3 effects) in the
evaporator. This fact is related to the increment in the total heat transfer
area that reduces the amount of heat required in the equipment. Note
that, although the operational costs are decreasing with the increasing
in the evaporator area, there is a threshold (3th effect) from that the

increment in the capital costs needed do not compensate such reduc-
tion in the amount of energy.

4.2. Single-effect evaporation process with vapor recompression

The proposed model can be used to optimize a single-effect evapora-
tion process with a single-stage compressor (SEE-SVR). In this situation,
the evaporator heat transfer area (and heat ow) is equal to 782.99 m2
(20,387.27 kW) and the compressor needed should has capacity of
1367.97 kW. Fig. 3 (a) shows the optimal solution obtained for the
major decision variables for the SEE-SVR process. The total annualized
cost for the SEE-SVR process is 2585 k US$ year 1,
including
1421 k US$ year 1 in capital cost and 1164 k US$ year 1 in electricity
expenses. Thus, the TAC is 20.2% lower than the optimal solution obtain-
ed for the MEE process with external vapor source.
By the inclusion of a feed-condensate preheater to promote thermal
integration, the heat transfer area of the single-effect evaporator (SEE-
SVR including thermal
integration) is increased for 834.17 m2
(19,780.44 kW). The compressor capacity is also increased for
1452.19 kW to compensate for the heat ow required in the SEE-SVR in-
cluding the thermal integration process. Moreover, the preheater re-
quired in the system has 4.80 m2 of heat transfer area for exchanging
403.28 kW of heat between the feed and condensate streams. Fig. 4
shows the optimal solution obtained for the major decision variables
for the SEE-SVR process including thermal integration. In this case, the
capital cost of investment in equipment is equal to 1511 k US$ year 1,
and the operating expenses related to electricity are 1235 k US$ year 1.
Thus, the total annualized cost for the SEE-SVR conguration is equal to
2746 k US$ year 1. Therefore, it is possible to achieve savings on total
process costs around 15.2% in comparison with the optimal solution ob-
tained for the MEE containing an external steam source (i.e., 3-effect
evaporator). However, the SEE-SVR system with thermal integration is
6.3% more expensive that the same process without preheated feed.

This result is due to the increasing in both the capital costs and opera-
tional expenses obtained for the SEE-SVR conguration with a
preheater.
Then, the model is used to optimize the single-effect evaporation
process with a multistage compressor (SEE-MVR). In this case, the evap-
orator heat transfer area (and heat ow) is equal to 793.92 m2
(20,387.26 kW). In addition, the process requires a 2-stage compressor
with capacities of 327.60 kW and 982.79 kW, respectively. The multi-
stage compressor demands 380.22 kW of energy related to cooling ser-
vices. Fig. 3 (b) shows the optimal solution obtained for the major
decision variables for the SEE-MVR process. The total annualized cost
for the SEE-MVR process is 2576 k US$ year 1, comprising
1423 k US$ year 1 in capital cost and 1153 k US$ year 1 in operational
expenses. Thus, the TAC is 20.4% lower than the optimal solution obtain-
ed for the MEE process with external vapor source. Additionally, the
SEE-MVR process is 6.2% more economical than SEE-SVR system and
0.4% cheaper than the SEE-SVR with thermal integration. In the last
case, the decrease in the total annualized cost is due to the reduced op-
erational expenses related to the use of a multistage compressor.
The SEE-MVR system including thermal integration presents a heat
transfer area for evaporation (and heat ow) equal to 847.51 m2
(19,780.44 kW). Furthermore, the optimal conguration requires a 2-
stage compressor with capacities of 346.82 kW and 1040.45 kW, respec-
tively. In this case, the multistage compressor consumes 395.16 kW of
energy related to the intercooler. The feed-condensate preheater used
in the process has 4.80 m2 of heat transfer area for exchanging
403.28 kW of energy. The capital cost of investment in equipment is
equal to 1515 k US$ year 1, and the operating expenses related to the
consumption of electricity are 1219 k US$ year 1. Thus, the total annu-
alized cost for the SEE-MVR conguration considering heat integration
is equal to 2734 k US$ year 1. Fig. 5 shows the optimal solution obtain-
ed for the major decision variables for the SEE-MVR process including
thermal integration. It should be noted that the optimal SEE-MVR sys-
tem conguration obtained is 6.2% more expensive than the same pro-
cess without thermal integration. The increase in the total annualized
cost is a consequence of the elevation in both capital costs and opera-
tional expenses. Note that the inclusion of a preheater in the SEE-MVR
system reduces the vapor pressure and, consequently, the temperature
in the evaporator. As a consequence, the heat ow provided by vapor
recompression is reduced elevating the heat
transfer area of

evaporation. As expected, higher temperatures in the evaporator (as ob-
tained for the SEE-MVR system without thermal integration) imply
higher overall heat transfer coefcients and, consequently, lower heat
transfer areas of evaporation.
On the other hand, the SEE-MVR system with thermal integration is
0.4% cheaper than the SEE-SVR system with preheated feed. The de-
crease in the total annualized cost is essentially due to the reduction
in the work capacity and related operational expenses. In addition, it
should be observed that the advantage of substituting the external
vapor source 〞by a mechanical multistage compressor〞 is again veri-
ed in the SEE-MVR process with thermal integration. In this case, the
optimal conguration obtained presents the total annualized cost
15.5% lower than the MEE system. Therefore, although the thermal inte-
gration does not provide better solutions for the single-stage evapora-
tion with vapor recompression, the multistage compressor reduces
operational costs 〞and consequently, the total annualized cost of the
process〞 in all cases studied.

4.3. Multiple-effect evaporation process with vapor recompression

In this section, the multiple-effect evaporation system is designed
considering the replacement of the external source of steam by a sin-
gle-stage equipment for vapor recompression (MEE-SVR). In this case,
the optimal solution is obtained for the MEE-SVR process composed of
2 effects of evaporation. The corresponding heat transfer areas (and
heat ow) are equal to 343.84 m2 (10,225.23 kW) and 282.21 m2
(10,262.95 kW), respectively. Under this conguration, the process de-
mands a single-stage compressor with the capacity of 820.41 kW. The
operating expenses related to the consumption of electricity are equal
to 698 k US$ year 1, while the capital costs of investment in all process
equipment are 1119 k US$ year 1. Thus, the total annualized cost of the
MEE system with this conguration is 1817 k US$ year 1.
It should be observed that contrary to the MEE evaporation process
with external steam source, the TAC is signicantly increased as the
number of effects is augmented in the multiple-effect evaporator. Con-
sequently, if a 3-effect evaporator 〞with heat transfers areas (and heat
ow) of 450.23 m2 (6752.5 kW), 469.13 m2 (6780.68 kW) and
304.19 m2 (6697.59 kW), respectively〞 including mechanical vapor
recompression (599.31 kW) is considered as the treatment plant, the
total annualized cost will be increased to 2289 k US$ year 1

(OPEX = 510k US$ year 1 and CAPEX = 1779k US$ year 1). This value
corresponds to an increment of 25.9% in relation to the TAC obtained
for the design with 2 effects of evaporation. Note that the increase in
the total annualized cost is due to the need for bigger evaporator heat
transfer areas, in which capital costs are signicantly augmented
when considering three (~ 59% more expensive) or more evaporation
effects. On the other hand, the total annualized cost obtained consider-
ing the MEE-SVR system with 2 evaporation effects (and single-stage
compressor) is 43.9% lower than the optimal solution found for the
steam-driven MEE process. This reduction in the total costs is possible
because, although a pressure manipulation equipment is used in the
process 〞requiring an increased total heat transfer area of evapora-
tion〞 the additional costs related to the inclusion in the MEE-SVR sys-
tem of such mechanical compressor (including operational expenses
and capital costs) do not exceed the expenses associated to external
steam source (~ 270% more expensive than electricity expenses). More-
over, the MEE-SVR process is 29.4% cheaper than the best solution ob-
tained for the single-effect evaporation process (i.e., SEE-MVR without
thermal integration). In this case, capital costs and operating expenses
related to electricity consumption are both reduced when considering
the multiple-effect evaporation process.
Afterwards, the MEE-SVR process is optimized considering thermal
integration through the inclusion of ash tanks and feed-condensate
preheater. In this case, the optimal conguration is again obtained
with 2 effects in the evaporator. The heat transfer areas (and heat
ow) of each evaporator effect are 246.25 m2 (9718.77 kW) and
247.38 m2 (9702.26 kW), respectively. Moreover, a single-stage me-
chanical compressor with the capacity of 823.11 kW is needed for meet-
ing the energy required in the process. In this case, thermal integration
is allowed in the process by using a preheater with area of 46.97 m2 able
to exchange 1774.31 kW of heat between the fresh water (distillate)
and the feed water. Additionally, 2 ashing tanks 〞with volumes
equal to 1.19 m3 and 2.39 m3, respectively〞 are used to separate the
distillate vapor, providing a further energy recovery in the MEE-SVR

system. Fig. 6 shows the optimal MEE-SVR process conguration obtain-
ed for this case study. The total annualized cost of the process with this
conguration is 1689 k US$ year 1, composed of 989 k US$ year 1 re-
lated to capital cost of investment in equipment and 700 k US$ year 1
to operating expenses of electricity consumption. Note that, the process
designed with 3 evaporation effects has a total annualized cost of
1904 k US$ year 1, composed of OPEX = 568k US$ year 1 and
CAPEX= 1336k US$ year 1. Therefore, analogously to the behavior ob-
served for the MEE-SVR system without thermal integration, the pro-
cess total annualized cost is signicantly increased when more
evaporator effects are considered in the system.
It should be highlighted that the MEE-SVR process design with ther-
mal integration is 38.5% cheaper than the SEE-SVR system with
preheating of the feed water. Moreover, the MEE-SVR process is 34.4%
less expensive than the best solution obtained for the single-effect evap-
oration process (i.e., SEE-MVR without thermal integration). In addition,
this MEE-SVR conguration (i.e., containing ash tanks and preheater)
allows for reducing costs in 7.1%, comparing with the optimal solution
obtained for the MEE-SVR without heat integration; and, 47.8% when
compared with the optimal solution found for the MEE process. By ana-
lyzing these results, it is possible to observe that the heat recovery in the
MEE-SVR process reduces signicantly the total heat transfer area
(~ 21% of reduction) required in the evaporator, in comparison with
the MEE-SVR without thermal integration. The equipment size reduc-
tion is responsible for the considerable decrease in the capital cost of in-
vestment (~ 12% of reduction) and, subsequently, in the total annualized
cost. Therefore, the thermal integration associated with the vapor
recompression cycle in the MEE-SVR system is essential for enhancing
energy efciency and, consequently, for reducing process costs.
After the single-stage compression step, the developed mathemati-
cal model is used to optimize the multiple-effect evaporation system,
considering multistage vapor recompression and thermal integration
(MEE-MVR). Observe that the optimization is performed considering
no pressure drop in the intercooler, and the inlet temperature in the

integration.

rst compression stage can be different from the inlet temperature in
the subsequent stage. In this case, the optimal conguration obtained
is composed of 2 effects of evaporation with heat transfer areas (and
heat ows) equal to 346.77 m2 (10,225.20 kW) and 282.21 m2
(10,262.92 kW), respectively. In addition, the process requires a 2-
stage compressor with capacities of 197.64 kW and 591.48 kW, respec-
tively. The multistage compressor demands 176.59 kW of energy relat-
ed to cooling services. The total annualized cost for the MEE-MVR
system with this conguration is 1805 k US$ year 1, comprising
1116 k US$ year 1 of capital cost of investment and 689 k US$ year 1
of operating expenses, related to cooling services and electricity con-
sumed by the compressor.
It should be noted that the total annualized cost obtained for the
MEE-MVR process represents 44.3% of savings in comparison with the
MEE process (with an external source of vapor). Moreover, the MEE-
MVR process is 29.9% cheaper than the best solution obtained for the
single-effect evaporation process (i.e., SEE-MVR without thermal inte-
gration). Additionally, the MEE-MVR system with thermal integration
is 0.7% cheaper than the MEE-SVR system without feed preheating.
The decrease in the total annualized cost is essentially due to the reduc-
tion in the work capacity and related electricity expenses.
Finally, the MEE-MVR process is optimized considering thermal in-
tegration by using intermediate ash tanks and feed-condensate pre-
heater. In this case, the optimal conguration is again obtained with 2
effects in the evaporator system. The heat transfer areas (and heat
ow) of each evaporation effect are 245.54 m2 (9660.40 kW) and
268.67 m2 (9646.39 kW), respectively. In addition, the optimal congu-
ration requires a 2-stage compressor with capacities of 204.13 kW and
612.40 kW, respectively. In this case, the multistage compressor con-
sumes 107.82 kW of energy related to the intercooler. A heat exchanger
of 80.53 m2 (1897.99 kW) is used to preheat the feed water, taking ad-
vantage of the energy from the condensate (fresh water). Additional en-
ergy is recovered in the MEE-MVR system by using 2 ashing tanks with

capacities of 1.19 m3 and 2.39 m3, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the optimal
MEE-MVR system conguration obtained for this case. The capital cost
of investment in equipment is equal to 1015 k US$ year 1, and the op-
erating expenses related to the consumption of electricity are
705 k US$ year1. Thus, the total annualized cost for the MEE-MVR con-
guration considering heat integration is equal to 1720 k US$ year 1.
Thus, the total annualized cost obtained for the MEE-MVR process
with thermal integration represents 46.9% of savings in comparison
with the MEE process (with an external source of vapor). The process
presents a reduction of 46.9% in the cost of the produced fresh water,
and 72.7% of decreasing in the energy consumed per cubic meter of pro-
duced water. Observe that the MEE-MVR process with this congura-
tion is 33.2% cheaper than the best solution obtained for the single-
effect evaporation process (i.e., SEE-MVR without thermal integration).
This reduction in the process expenses represent savings of ~ 33% in the
cost of the cubic meter of fresh water; and, the decrease of ~ 39% in the
electric power consumption per cubic meter of produced water. More-
over, the MEE-MVR process is 4.7% less expensive than the same process
without thermal integration. Note that, in this case, the possibility of
using the feed-distillate preheater allied to a larger compressor reduces
signicantly the heat transfer area of evaporation (~ 18% of reduction),
compensating even the increment in the operational expenses related
to the additional electricity consumption required by the process.
Table 3 shows the optimal results obtained for the distinct evaporation
systems congurations considered for the optimization of the desalina-
tion process.
Therefore, among all process congurations evaluated, the best op-
tion for the desalination of the shale gas owback water (at
70 g kg 1) is the MEE-SVR including thermal integration. In this case,
the cost of the produced fresh water is 6.70 US$ per cubic meter, pre-
senting an electric power consumption of 2.78 US$ per cubic meter of
fresh water. However, it should be emphasized that the optimal cong-
uration obtained is strongly dependent on the salinity of the owback

water to be treated. This dependence is studied in the following section.
Lastly, it is remarked that in all SEE/MEE systems congurations studied,
the specication of the brine salinity (300 g kg 1) close to salt satura-
tion condition allows for obtaining high recovery ratios of fresh water
(0.77 in all cases) as it is shown in Table 3.

4.4. Analyzing the SEE/MEE model sensitivity

The proposed model can be used for the SEE/MEE process design
considering a wide range of feed water salinities. A simple analysis of
the SEE/MEE model sensitivity is performed to assess the inuence of

the feed water salinity on system performance and total process costs.
Thus, the optimal solutions found in the design step (considering feed
water salinity equal to 70 g kg 1) for the single and multiple-effect sys-
tems congurations have been evaluated under salinity conditions
varying from 10 to 220 g kg 1 (10每220 k ppm). In all cases, the brine
specication remains the same (i.e., 300 g kg 1) to achieve discharges
close to ZLD conditions. It should be remembered that the consideration
of higher salinities implies the need for lower brine concentration, since
the system is always designed to achieve the same outlet condition (i.e.,
brine concentrate near to salt saturation condition). The results obtain-
ed for the SEE-MVR system without thermal integration present a linear
decrease in the total annualized cost of the process, as higher salinities
are considered for the feed water. Fig. 8 (a) displays the effect of the
owback water salinity on the SEE-MVR process costs. The total annual-
ized cost of the system is equal to 3167 k US$ year 1 for feed salinity of
10 g kg 1. Under more elevated concentrations, a signicant reduction
in the total costs is observed for this conguration. At feed salinity of
220 g kg 1, the total annualized cost of the process is 1147 k US$ year 1.
This value represents a diminution of approximately 64% in comparison
with the optimal solution found for the process at lower salinity condi-
tion. In this case, the system conguration exhibits a proportional less-
ening in both curves for capital costs and operational expenses. This
fact is due to the smaller equipment size (~ 61% of reduction between
the evaluated extremes points) and the consequent need for lower en-
ergy consumption (~ 67% of savings in operational expenses). Therefore,
the performance of the system (measured by the total evaporation area
and compression capacity) is considerably affected for the shale gas

owback water salinity. In this case, the evaporator area is reduced by
~ 69%, whereas the compression work is decreased by ~ 66%.
The total costs for the MEE-MVR system with thermal integration for
different feed water salinities are shown in Fig. 8 (b). In this case, the re-
duction observed in the total annualized cost for the salinity extreme
conditions (10 and 220 g kg1) is not so expressive as in the single-ef-
fect process. For the rst salinity, the MEE-MVR system presents a total
annualized cost of 1959 k US$ year 1, which is composed by
1166 k US$ year 1 related to capital costs and 793 k US$ year 1 associ-
ated to operational expenses. For the feed water with 220 g kg 1, the
total annualized cost of the system is equal to 1216 k US$ year 1
(OPEX = 391k US$ year 1 and CAPEX = 825k US$ year 1). This value
constitutes a decrease of ~ 38% in the total annualized cost, (~ 29% in
the capital cost and ~ 51% in the operational expenses) when both con-
ditions are compared. Concerning the system performance, the com-
pression work is substantially more affected by the increase in the
feed water salinity over the total evaporation area. Therefore, the com-
pression work is decreased by ~ 52% while the evaporator area is re-
duced by ~ 29%.
The MEE-SVR process with thermal integration is the last system to
be analyzed. The results obtained for this conguration are displayed in
Fig. 8 (c).
In this case, the total annualized cost is equal to
1925 k US$ year 1 for the treatment of the feed water at 10 g kg 1.
The total annualized cost comprises 1147 k US$ year 1 associated to
capital costs and 778 k US$ year 1 to operational expenses. At feed
water salinity of 220 g kg 1, the total annualized cost of the MEE-SVR
process is 1839 k US$ year 1 (OPEX = 238k US$ year 1 and

cycle (MEE-SVR) and thermal integration; and, (d) comparison between the total annualized costs obtained for the processes SEE-MVR, MEE-MVR and MEE-SVR under different feed
salinity conditions.

245

CAPEX = 1601k US$ year 1). This value represents a reduction of ~ 5% in
comparison with the optimal solution found for the process at
10 g kg 1. The system with this conguration presents ~ 69% of savings
in operational expenses. On the other hand, the capital cost of invest-
ment is increased by ~ 40%. This fact is due to the signicant increase
in the total evaporation area (~ 93%), whereas the compression work
is reduced by ~ 70%. However, the MEE-SVR system conguration ex-
hibits an inection point at the feed water salinity equal to 80 g kg 1.
Therefore, the process presents a minimum total annualized cost of
1646 k US$ year 1 under this condition.
Finally, Fig. 8 (d) shows the comparison between the total annual-
ized costs obtained for the processes SEE-MVR, MEE-MVR and MEE-
SVR under different feed salinity conditions. In this gure, it is possible
to observe that the MEE-SVR process (with thermal integration) pre-
sents the lower total costs at salinities between 10 and 100 g kg 1. In
this concentration range, the SEE-MVR (without thermal integration)
is the most expensive process for the treatment of the shale gas
owback water. Between the salinities of 100 to 150 g kg 1, the MEE-
MVR system (with thermal integration) becomes the most economical
process to achieve brine discharges close to ZLD conditions. From salin-
ities higher than 150 g kg 1, the MEE-SVR system is the less benecial
process. Note that the MEE-SVR system presents the lower compared
total annualized cost for the feed salinity at 70 g kg 1. Interestingly,
the SEE-MVR system has the lower total annualized cost for salinities
higher than 180 g kg 1. Observe that the SEE-MVR process is widely
used in the seawater desalination industry, in which there is no need
to achieve ZLD conditions.

4.5. Simulating the MEE process

To verify the accuracy of the proposed mathematical programming
model, a simulation of the process has been carried out using the com-
mercial software Aspen HYSYS (version V8.8). With this aim, the MEE-
MVR superstructure shown in Fig. 1 has been simulated considering
steady state conditions. The resulting MEE-MVR process ow diagram
in Aspen HYSYS is displayed in Fig. 9. The MEE-MVR system has been se-
lected due to its elevated complexity in comparison with the other sys-
tems designed.
The thermodynamic package NTRL-electrolytes has been chosen for
the process simulation. Moreover, the results obtained for the decision
variables (i.e., inlet and outlet pressures and temperatures, and mass
owrates) in the design step (shown in Fig. 7) have been introduced
in the simulator to estimate the work capacities or heat ows of all
equipment. A reasonably good agreement has been observed between
the design and simulated values for the MEE-MVR process. The simula-
tion results showed that the compressor stages should have the capac-
ities of 208.7 kW and 618.3 kW, respectively. In this case, the intercooler
consumes 111.8 kW of energy. These values present differences of 0.9%,
2.2% and 3.7%, respectively, in relation to the design ones. In the simula-
tion, the effects of the evaporator present heat ows equal to 9555 kW
and 9652 kW, respectively. The difference between the values obtained
from the model and the simulated ones are equal to 1.2% and 0.1%,
respectively.
The simulation of the preheater has also shown high precision with
the modeled results. The difference between the two values is equal to

Fig. 9. MEE-MVR process ow diagram in Aspen HYSYS used to validate the results obtained in the system design step.

246

0.8%. In this case, the heat duty simulated is equal to 1882 kW. More-
over, all the remaining simulated values (including some inlet or outlet
temperatures, pressures and mass owrates) exhibit variations in rela-
tion to the design values lower than 1%. It should be highlighted that the
low differences obtained between the modeling and simulation are
mainly due to the use of correlations to estimate some decision vari-
ables in the mathematical model.

4.6. Computational aspects

The proposed NLP model for the optimal design of SEE/MEE systems
was implemented in GAMS software (version 24.6.1) and optimized
using CONOPT solver [67]. It is emphasized that the optimization of NLP
problems using reduced gradient method-based solver 〞like CONOPT〞
cannot guarantee global optimal solutions, unless the problem is convex
(i.e., convex objective function and constraints) [68]. However, good solu-
tions can be expected due to the problem size and robustness of the pro-
posed model. All examples studied were solved using a computer with an
Intel Core i5-2520 M 2.5 GHz processor and 8 GB RAM running Windows
8.1. The CPU time did not exceed 1 s for any of the CONOPT optimizations.
The statistics of the SEE/MEE model and computational efforts for solving
the problem are reported in Table 4.
It should be highlighted that the imposition of limits (i.e., lower and
upper bounds) on all decision variables are essential to solve the SEE/
MEE model. These bounds should be carefully dened to guarantee
that all functions can be properly evaluated by the NLP solver. Thus, it
is crucial to ensure all achievable exibility in the lower and upper
bounds. Additionally, it is very important to provide good starting
points by setting level values on all decision variables. In general, a
NLP solver (CONOPT) is not able to nd optimal or at least feasible solu-
tions when bad starting points are chosen.

5. Conclusions

A new optimization model for the simultaneous synthesis of SEE/
MEE systems is proposed, including mechanical vapor recompression
and thermal integration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst
work proposing the SEE/MEE process (including MVR and thermal inte-
gration) for the treatment of high-salinity owback water from shale
gas production. The mathematical model is formulated as a NLP prob-
lem and solved using GAMS software, by minimizing the total annual-
ized cost of desalinating the shale gas owback water. For this
purpose, a multiple-effect superstructure is developed including several
effects of evaporation and multistage mechanical compression. In addi-
tion, condensate ashing tanks and feed/condensate preheater are used
to enhance energy recovery. As the compressor with intercooling is an
electricity-driven device, no additional energy source is needed in the

SEE/MEE process. Nevertheless, the mathematical model allows for eas-
ily changing the energy supply if electricity services are not available.
The optimal SEE/MEE conguration should achieve high recovery
ratio of produced fresh water and brine near to ZLD condition 〞through
the specication of the outow brine salinity near to salt saturation con-
ditions〞, by minimizing the process costs. The objective function ac-
counts for the capital cost of investment in equipment, and operating
expenses related to cooling services and electricity consumption. It is
worth noting that improving the process cost-effectiveness by reducing
brine discharges allows decreasing the environmental impacts associat-
ed to energy consumption and waste disposal.
It is remarked that the SEE/MEE design considering MVR and ther-
mal integration is a complex process, seeking to nd the optimal system
conguration with minimum heat transfer area and use of energy ser-
vices. All streams properties are unknown decision variables for the pro-
cess design. In addition to the raised number of variables and
constraints, the high non-convexity and nonlinearity of the cost correla-
tions further increase the model complexity.
First, the SEE and MEE systems have been compared in terms of their
applicability to produce fresh water and achieve ZLD conditions. Among
all process congurations studied, the MEE-SVR including thermal inte-
gration has presented the lower total annualized cost of process
(1689 k US$ year 1). Therefore, this conguration represents the best
option for the desalination of the shale gas owback water with salinity
of 70 g kg 1. The MEE-SVR process including thermal integration also
presents the lower value for the cost of the produced fresh water
(6.70 US$ per cubic meter). However, all congurations evaluated
have obtained high recovery ratios of fresh water (77% in all cases),
and they have successfully achieved brine outlet specication (i.e.,
brine discharges near ZLD conditions).
Sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the optimal SEE/
MEE process conguration and performance under distinct feed water
salinity conditions. The results obtained highlight the robustness of the
proposed model to cost-effectively optimize SEE/MEE systems under
low and high feed water concentrations. Moreover, sensitivity analysis
emphasizes that the optimal process conguration is strongly dependent
of the salinity of the owback water to be treated. The MEE-MVR system
conguration is the most benecial process for the treatment of feed
water at lower salinities (10每100 g kg1), whereas the SEE-MVR is the
most economical at salinities higher than 180 g kg1.
Lastly, simulation results by using Aspen HYSYS emphasize the accu-
racy of the proposed model for synthesizing the MEE-MVR system. A
good agreement has been observed between the design and simulated
values, showing high model accuracy in relation to realistic data of de-
sign. The difference between the design and simulated performance pa-
rameters (including heat ows and compression work) of the process
have not exceeded 4%. This small difference is attributed to the correla-
tions (of the data obtained from HYSYS-OLI by using a more rigorous

model formulation.
Further development of the process technology is needed to ensure
the best possibilities for the treatment of the shale gas owback water.
Thus, future works include the study of the inuence of the overall heat
transfer coefcient on the process conguration and performance; anal-
ysis of the uncertainty associated to the concentration data of the wells;
and, consideration of the salinity variation as a function of the explora-
tion time. Finally, the assessment of environmental impacts following
LCA principles should also be considered for the optimal design of
more environmentally conscious processes.
