abstract

An accurate 2-D numerical model that accounts for concentration polarization and osmotic effects is
developed for the cross-ow ltration in a membrane channel. Focused on the coupling between laminar
hydrodynamics and mass transfer, the numerical approach solves the solute conservation equation together
with the steady Navier-Stokes equations under the Prandtl approximation, which offers a simplied frame-
work to enforce the non-linear coupling between ltration and concentration polarization at the membrane
surface. The present approach is rst validated thanks to the comparison with classical exact analytical
solutions for hydrodynamics and/or mass transfer, as well as with approximated analytical solutions that
attempted at coupling the various phenomena. The effects of the main parameters in cross-ow reverse
osmosis (RO) or nanoltration (NF) (feed concentration, axial ow rate, operating pressure and membrane
permeability) on streamlines, velocity prole, longitudinal pressure drop, local permeate ux and solute
concentration prole are predicted with the present numerical model, and discussed. With the use of data
reported from NF and RO experiments, the Prandtl approximation model is shown to accurately correlate
both average permeate ux and local solute concentration over a wide range of operating conditions.

1. Introduction

In cross-ow ltration, species remain in the axial (or feed) ow,
while permeate (or puried transverse ow) leaves the duct by
leaking transversally through the membrane. The accumulation of
rejected species at the membrane inner wall results in a concentration
polarization (i.e. a large solute enhancement) which - combined with
osmosis - can induce a substantial reduction in permeation. On the
one hand, the basic theoretical description of the cross-ow ltra-
tion refers to the seminal contribution by Berman [7] that treats of
the channel ow driven by a uniform leakage at the wall. Other con-
tributions on the case of the ※pure solvent§ ow proposed several
analytical solutions that accounts for the pressure dependence on
permeate ux (see Regirer [41], Haldenwang [19], Tilton et al. [56],
Bernales and Haldenwang [9]). On the other hand, an exact analytical
solution for the solute transfer in Berman ow has been derived in
Haldenwang et al. [21] and accounts for concentration polarization
and the subsequent hindrance to permeation in the limit of certain
RO/NF congurations.
Permeate ux actually results from the coupling of those trans-

through the membrane. The present contribution can essentially be
seen as an improvement in the numerical eciency for studying
the laminar ows involved in ltration. It is however known that
the applicability domain of such an approach can be extended by
introducing the concept of turbulent viscosity and turbulent diffusiv-
ity (as we shall do in the present Subsection 3.3).

This issue has also been recently identied as a challenge for
nanoltration and reverse osmosis processes [58] and [33]. The lit-
erature is now rich with studies on RO/NF modeling. In the present
approach, we hence pay a special attention to develop an ecient
predictive model that allows us to accurately describe the full cou-
pling between ow, concentration polarization and hindrance to
permeation. As discussed below, eciency and accuracy come from
the fact that the solver is fast and has no limitations in terms of
numerical degrees of freedom.
Whereas the conservation laws for diluted solutions of salt and
water are well-admitted, solvent and solute transport through a
membrane remains a quite controversial issue. A large number of
investigators have proposed numerous local models derived from
different mechanisms. They are based either on the principles
of irreversible thermodynamics models (Kedem-Katchalsky model,
Spiegler-Kedem model) or on various homogeneous membrane mod-
els (Porous model, solution-diffusion model). The oldest of these
models are analyzed in the contribution by Soltanieh [48]. More
recent models describing the different local transport phenomena
within the membranes with an increasing complexity can be found in
Wijmans and Baker [61], Gauwbergen and Baeyens [17], Weissbrodt
et al. [60], Moresi et al. [38], Kahdim et al.[24], Mehdizadeh et al.
[36], Mane et al.[35], Malaeb and Ayoub [33]. Below, we shall nev-
ertheless use a minimal model, since it is essential to investigate the
associated limitations.
An evident improvement in modeling consists in coupling a local
membrane model with the upstream composition of the solution.
Several investigations [6,12,22,23,39,40] have predicted permeate
ux by using the combined solution-diffusion/lm model also known
as the Kimura-Sourirajan model. The integrated or differential lm
theory equations (convection due to the pressure difference and back
diffusion owing to the concentration gradient) have also been used
by Urama [57] and Ahmad [2] while they applied the Spiegler-Kedem
models in the membrane. It is worth noting that all these studies are
based only on mass transfer considerations forgetting the inuence
of hydrodynamics. Such an approach that involves only averaged
data all along the membrane is attractive in view of its simplicity
and surely convenient for the description of a complex multistage
membrane process in transient condition. However, just using aver-
aged conditions assimilated to feed parameters along the membrane
length becomes seemingly unrealistic when an industrial membrane
module where a spatial variation of pressure and solute concentration
appears in the long cross-ow membrane channel is involved.
We hence turn towards 1-D models that consider the local longi-
tudinal variations along membrane duct. The simplest approach we
can mention conceives the feed channel as a black box which can
be represented by a series of perfect mixing cells with exchange. No
information is needed on hydrodynamics and mechanisms of trans-
port. This is the purpose of Roth et al. [42] who used the residence
time distribution (RTD) method by analyzing in some spiral-wound
membranes the response to a stimulus injection of tracer. The main
drawback of this very simplied method is to ignore the local solute
concentration in boundary layer which has a great inuence on
permeate ux via the phenomenon of concentration polarization.
In other 1-D studies, the material balance is solved numerically
without taking the velocity eld into account, the hydrodynamic
effects being limited to pressure drop along the membrane, which is
generally described by the Hagen-Poiseuille or the Ergun equations
[11,45-47]. Material balances have also been considered numerically
with the assumption of a negligible pressure drop by Malek et al.
[34] who introduced a simple model based on a lumped transport
parameter approach combined with the solution-diffusion model. A
modied solution-diffusion model [43] was developed to take the
sorption pattern into account.
Several approaches investigated the cell model based on sin-
gle material balances and consisted in dividing the membrane into

several parts that were considered as a well-mixed reactors. Voros
et al. [59] neglected pressure drop in comparison with the trans-
membrane applied pressure, while others works treated of the inu-
ence of pressure drop [5,13,16]. MATHCAD8 package was also used
to solve the mass transport equations across the membrane and the
boundary layer [3]. Let us also mention that an analytical model
treating the membrane as a heterogeneous system [52] was obtained
with the assumption of constant driving pressure.
To conclude on the large amount of 1-D models, we stress on
the fact that these approaches at least postulate one of the following
strong simplications:

每 simplied pressure drop derived from the particular case of
ow in an impermeable duct,
每 permeate ux and concentration polarization are estimated
from mass transfer coecients derived from dimensionless
correlations on Sherwood number;
每 hydrodynamics is not investigated, only solute mass trans-
fer is considered neglecting the inuence of the cross-ow on
solution composition.

It is however accepted that permeate ux has a great inuence
on cross-ow, particularly on pressure drop in the situation of highly
permeable membrane [20,37]. Concerning the use of mass trans-
fer coecients, the diculty lies in the proper choice of the most
suitable correlation among the large number of correlations found
in literature which are often eclectic. As concentration polariza-
tion results from the establishment of a solute boundary layer, it is
essential to couple hydrodynamics and mass transport.
We now devote what follows to more accurate models that
deal with the 2-D variations of pressure, ow velocities and solute
concentration in the feed channel.
We rst consider the analytical approaches, which are approxi-
mate solutions for the time being, even though some exact solutions
have been derived in certain limit cases. The rst concern of the
approximate analytical approaches considers the various manners
of incorporating a satisfactory velocity eld into the mass transfer
equation. Then, the lm theory is often invoked to describe the cou-
pling between permeate ux and concentration polarization. In this
way, an analytical expression of the permeate ux can be established.
This has rstly been done for the case of a solid suspension [50].
Song and Elimelech used the excess concentration subtracted by
feed concentration to balance the convection and diffusion of solute
within the polarization concentration layer. The validation analy-
sis of such an approach can be found in Kim and Hoek [26]. Later,
this model was extended and applied to salt solutions specic to
RO membranes [53]. The specic case of a long-narrow channel
in which concentration polarization could develop all along the
channel was also investigated [49]. To take account of the variable
cross-ow velocity, a total salt balance model was proposed for
different considered kinds of shear ow [51]. Let us mention that
Sundaramoorthy [55] also proposed an analytical model that pro-
vides us with explicit expressions for spatial variations of pressure,
uid velocity and solute concentration on the feed channel side of a
spiral wound RO/NF membrane module.
If the permeation is supposed to remain more or less uniform all
along the channel, the ow eld can be described by the Berman
exact solution [7]. This expression is then used for solving the mass
transport equation in the diffusion layer [1]. Kim [25] solved the
convection-diffusion equation with a Berman ow approximated as
a linear shear ow in the close proximity of the membrane sur-
face. In Annex, we briey recall the exact analytical solution to the
mass transfer in a solution carried by a Berman ow, as obtained
by Haldenwang et al. [21]. Note that the latter solution precisely
describes the concentration polarization in the HP-LR limit (HP-LR
for high pressure-low recovery).

In addition to these analytical contributions, numerous numer-
ical studies have to be mentioned. Bhattacharyya [10] developed a
numerical approach that solves the diffusion-convection equation
to compute the concentration proles throughout a reverse osmo-
sis membrane. Ma and Song [32] solved the convection-diffusion
equation coupled with Navier-Stokes equations in the feed channel.
This work is based on rigorous mass and momentum balances in both
the radial and axial membrane dimensions. We now reach an impor-
tant aspect in the present modeling: it concerns the calculation of
the hydrodynamics and mass transfer coupling with high accuracy
thanks to computational uids dynamics (CFD) softwares. Wiley and
Fletcher developed a CFD model of concentration polarization and
uid ow in membrane process (see Wiley and Fletcher [62]). Later,
they extended the model to the specic ltration processes [4,15].
A great advantage of the CFD methods lies in their ability to treat
of complex system geometries. Certain CFD software are indeed
convenient to simulate momentum and mass transport in mem-
brane ltration system with spacer-lled channels [54] in order to
modify the cross-ow. The fully coupled governing equations for
uid dynamics and mass transfer were investigated [31], and more
recently in Salcedo-Diaz et al. [44], where the CFD software Comsol
Multiphysics has been used. A 3-D numerical solution of the coupled
uid dynamics and solute transfer equation [30] was obtained with
the use of Ansys CFX solver.
It is worthy of note that the numerical approach in cross-ow l-
tration is faced with an unusual boundary condition that nonlinearly
relates permeation ux and concentration at the membrane surface.
The general CFD softwares treat this diculty in an iterative way that
is founded on standard methods for solving large non-linear systems;
in practice, this limits the number of nodes to get a fast convergence.
For instance, in Salcedo-Diaz et al. [44] the number of nodes is about
3.104 . The aim of the present numerical approach is to develop a
tailor-made modeling, which does not have such a limitation (our
standard runs will be able to involve 2.107 nodes and will take one
ten of seconds on a standard Intel I5 processor).
Actually, an elegant manner to save computational efforts is to
consider the laminar Navier-Stokes equations in the limit of the
Prandtl approximation. This approach - fully justied in most chan-
nel laminar ltration systems - involves a ※time marching like§ solver
along the channel, which makes easier the treatment of the non-
linear boundary condition. The Prandtl approximation applies on all
conservation laws for a chemical solution owing in a cross-ow
ltration channel. Therefore, the present approach aims at account-
ing for concentration polarization and osmotic counter-pressure,
expecting to predict permeate ux and concentration prole, at any
point all along the channel, with a computational cost low enough to
develop an exhaustive parametric study. Furthermore, we focus our
interest on cross-ow ltration at steady state. The uid is incom-
pressible and the channel is supposed to be narrow. As a result, this
paper takes place within a continuous effort towards predictive l-
tration models, the eciency of which increases in terms of precision
and in capacities of analysis.
It is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the gov-
erning equations and the main hypotheses. We briey recall why
the Prandtl approximation of the conservation laws is justied.
The numerical method that solves the Prandtl differential system
is described. In Section 3, we rst compare our numerical results
with the Berman exact solution and the associated exact solution for
mass transfer [21]. Second, other approximated models (Elimelech＊s
model and total salt balance model) are also compared with the
present numerical predictions for the case of a pure solvent and of
a single solute solution. Finally, we present the comparison between
our model predictions and several experimental data from reverse
osmosis experiments of the literature. In Appendix, we briey recall
the spirit of the different analytical results that we need for conduct-
ing the validation step [21,50,51].

2. Numerical solution of Prandtl system for ltration

2.1. Main hypotheses and conservation laws at steady state

The present 2-D numerical development is focused on modeling
the concentration polarization and the osmotic (counter-)pressure
that occur in the steady cross-ow ltration with one solute diluted
solution. The experiments on reverse osmosis show that the rejec-
tion of solute is nearly total in most situations. To simplify the
approach - and reduce the number of independent parameters - we
suppose that the solute rejection is total.
The Prandtl approximation corresponds to a simplication that
produces an important gain in numerical eciency. The price-to-
pay is the following: when we shall decide to cancel the streamwise
diffusive terms, we shall renounce to study the details of any recir-
culating phenomena, as what happens between two spacers.
Two semi-permeable parallel walls compose the 2-D channel as
2d. This denes the computational domain as {d < x < d} ℅ {0 <
schematically shown in Fig. 1. The channel is of length L and spacing
z < L}. The uid is supposed to be Newtonian, incompressible and
its physical properties, such as dynamical viscosity l 0 and density
q0 , are supposed uniform. Inlet conditions (at z = 0) are the given
axial mean velocity Win , the xed feed concentration Cin and the xed
inlet pressure Pin . To simplify our development again, the effect of
partial fouling or cake formation on permeate ux is supposed to be
inexistent or negligible in comparison with the hindrance due to the
osmotic (counter-)pressure. In other words, I0 , the membrane resis-
tance is considered as constant and uniform all along the channel.
This allows us to dene Uin , the permeation velocity in pure solvent
cross-ow, as

Uin =

Pin

I0

(1)

Accordingly with the Darcy law for porous media and the Van＊t
Hoff law for osmotic pressure, and considering a total rejection
called Darcy-Starling law which relates UW ( z), the local permeation
of the membrane, the Spiegler-Kedem model leads us to the so-
velocity at the wall, to pressure PW and osmotic pressure Posm
W as:

2.2. Non-dimensioning

At this point, we have several order of magnitude already dened:
d, Uin , Win , Pin , Cin determine the order of magnitude for the varia-
tions of x, U, W, P and C . To set an order of magnitude for the axial
coordinate, we add Lde , the so-called dead-end length (or exhaustion
length for clear water) [19],

Lde =

Rin is the ※pure solvent§ transverse Reynolds number, k is the dimen-
sionless length of the channel reduced by Lde , the exhaustion length
(or dead-end length). In practice, experimentalists choose k < 1.
a is the square root of the ratio of Hagen-Poiseuille pressure drop
throughout the exhaustion length to trans-membrane pressure and
b is the dimensionless permeability of the membrane, the typical
values of which are much less than unity (for a more detailed discus-
sion on those numbers, refer to Haldenwang [19]). Pein is the ※pure
solvent§ transverse P谷clet number. Nosm , the ratio of the osmotic
pressure in absence of polarization to the operating pressure Pin , will
be denoted the osmotic number. Note that Nosm must be less than 1
in pressure-driven ltration.
We are now able to rewrite the whole system, in the domain
]  1, 1[℅]0, k[, as the following non-dimensional form:

In the left-hand-side of Eqs. (20)每(21), we have gathered the
terms of these equations that are mathematically identical to that of
heat equation. This Prandtl system for cross-ow ltration calls for
the following comments.

Remark 1. If the above inlet data at z = 0 are symmetrical, the lam-
inar solution of the system will develop symmetrically with respect
to x = 0. Therefore, assuming symmetrical boundary conditions at
putational domain reducing to {0 ≒ x ≒ 1} ℅ {0 ≒ z ≒ k} with the
x = 0 allows us to gain half of the computational effort, the com-
following boundary conditions on the axis (x = 0):

u(0, z) = 0,

 w
 x

(0, z) = 0,

 C
 x

(0, z) = 0

(22)

(13)

This assumption will hold in all what follows.

Remark 2. Eq. (19) expresses the fact that pressure only depends on
z, the stream-wise position. Eqs. (20) and (21) are clearly of parabolic
type, the pressure being - in each section - the Lagrange multiplier
that allows us to satisfy the following constraint

wdx = u(1, z) =  [p(z)  Nosm CW (z)]

(23)

(cid:8) 1

0

d
dz

which is obtained owing to transverse integration of Eq. (18). The
forthcoming numerical method exploits this mathematical property.
Furthermore, the parabolic nature of this system only requires
boundary conditions at inlet. Hence, the term ※appropriate bound-
ary conditions§ previously mentioned after Eq. (17) becomes now
dened and simply reduce to entrance conditions at z = 0: only,
suitable entrance x-proles on w and C are required.

Remark 3. Conservation laws are non-linear by nature. Here, their
non-linearity is increased by the boundary condition: Pein uC 
 C/ x = 0 at x = 1, which non-linearly combines permeation
velocity and solute concentration. This coupling is tremendously
important since it governs polarization and permeation. Therefore,
this nonlinearity needs to be numerically enforced iteratively, as
described below.

2.4. A new numerical approach

Technically, the solution method for solving the steady conser-
vation laws: equations from Eq. (18) to Eq. (21), coupled with the
boundary conditions (22) and (17) is performed by using nite dif-
ference methods (FDM) of order two. The computational domain
is discretized using a regular mesh in both transverse and axial
direction. A regular mesh is not optimal transversally, but a large
discretization is permitted, since the numerical cost is low. As a mat-
ter of fact, the conservation laws being conceived in the context of
Prandtl approximation, the system is parabolic, the axial coordinate
playing the role of the time. Hence, for a given transverse section z,
we solve the coupling - which is non-linear - by an iterative process.
One iteration is as follows: we rst solve the concentration eld, then
the axial velocity eld together with pressure, and nally the trans-
verse velocity eld. The solver iterates until a certain convergence
criterion is satised in what concerns the simultaneous satisfaction
of all boundary conditions or couplings, in particular, when the con-
sistency between local permeation velocity UW , local pressure p and
local wall concentration CW is achieved. At this convergence stage,
we are in condition to proceed with the computation of the various
elds in the next transverse section until the whole length of the
channel is reached.

2.3. Prandtl system for cross-ow ltration

in /W 2

Note that the ratio b/a2 reduces to U2
in , which is by nature of
RO/NF cross-ow ltrations a very small quantity (as small as 10 6 ).
Incompressibility condition (13)
conrms
that
the non-
dimensional quantities u and w have the same order of magnitude
for their different variations of the RHS of Eqs. (14) and (15). There-
fore, transverse variation of pressure is b/a2 times as small as its
axial variation. It can easily be deduced that pressure is constant
within a channel section (i.e. p(x, z) √ p(z)).
The same rationale applies when comparing transverse diffu-
sion with axial diffusion. It is clear that both magnitudes are in
U2
in ratio. This incites us to cancel the axial diffusion terms in the
differential equations.
Consequently, the following set of equations are validated for a
large class of ltration processes. This is the so-called Prandtl approx-
imation of the conservation laws. Note that the mathematical nature
of these equations has changed, since we switch from a set of ellip-
tic equations to a set of parabolic equations, in which the variable ※z§
plays the same role as the time in the heat equation.

As the system of equations [from Eq. (18) to Eq. (21)] is of
parabolic type, we now resort to the terminology generally used for
the discretization of heat equation with nite differencing. Let us
dene w(n)
[resp. C (n)
], the value of unknown w [resp. C] at point
{x = jDx, z = nDz} for 0 ≒ j ≒ J and 0 ≒ n ≒ N, whereDx = 1/J
and Dz = k/N are the mesh sizes in both directions. We suppose
that all transverse proles (velocity eld
, scalar concen-
tration eld C (n)
and local pressure p(n) ) are known up to the section
z = nDz. The purpose of the numerical scheme is to compute the all
unknown elds
and p(n +1) in the next section
z = (n + 1)Dz.
In channel section z = (n+ 1)Dz, the permeation velocity u(n+1)
is
a key-stone for the numerical method. Since the permeation velocity
is involved in the non-linear boundary condition, it assessment will
be obtained as the convergence of an iterative process where U(k) ,
k = 0, 1, 2,﹞ ﹞ ﹞ , represents a series of local permeation estimates. At
convergence of the iterative process, we shall set u(n+1)
= lim U (k) .
The nal numerical system to be solved incorporates a discretiza-
tion of the differential operators. More precisely, for the transverse
coordinate, the following centered nite difference operators of
order two are chosen:

We now proceed with the computation of the axial velocity eld
w(n +1) . In the same manner as that used for the concentration eld,
Eq. (20) is developed by its respective discretization. It is worthy not-
ing that the no-slip condition w(n+1)
= 0 (i.e. at node j = J) reduce
the unknown eld w(n +1) to J unknowns. However the whole system
has always J + 1 unknowns due to additional unknown p(n +1) . There-
fore, a complementary constraint is required. The latter unknown
depends on boundary condition u = p  Nosm C that holds at the
membrane (x = 1) and after integration of the incompressibility con-
straint (18) we obtain another relationship to relate all unknowns
to p(n +1) ) and complement the tri-diagonal system.
From the prole w(n +1) , the incompressibility constraint allows
us to compute the transverse velocity prole u(n +1) and the permeate
velocity U(K) At this stage, all elds C (n+1)
are known. The new permeation velocity can be computed thanks to
net trans-membrane pressure, as

We then check the convergence of the procedure by comparing
the new ltration with that of the previous step in the loop. More
precisely, we perform the following test:

where Econv is a certain criterion of convergence.
If convergence is not reached, a new iteration is performed for
the same section z = (n + 1)Dz with the new guess of permeation
Uk = Uk + y(Uk  Uk +1 ), where y is a relaxation factor used to speed
up the convergence, until an acceptable permeation velocity UK sat-
ises the convergence criterion. After each iterative loop, all elds
and p(n +1) are stored. If convergence is attained,
the computation of the next axial section is prepared by setting all
the memories affected to section (n  1) with the corresponding val-
ues just obtained for section (n) and elds of section (n) with the
values of section (n + 1). Now we are in condition to restart the pre-
vious iterative process for the next section z = (n + 1)Dz, following
the same calculation sequence until z = k = NDz (i.e. n = N). All
calculation steps are schematically described in Fig. 2.
A classical study of dependency on mesh size has been per-
formed [8] in both axial and transverse directions; this numerical
check conrms the order two expected from the nite difference
approximations, that we have used.

3. Validation and results

Even though we have derived a numerical approach rather light,
we need to validate the numerical technique, as well as the spirit of
the Prandtl approximation. The best manner is to resort to exact ana-
lytical solutions, even when their eciency with respect to ltration
is limited. Once this step is completed, we can tackle the numerical
predictions of well-documented experiments.

3.1. Validation with exact analytical solutions

First of all, the numerical model is validated by comparison with
the Berman ow. This validation implies the simulation of a uniform
permeation of pure solvent, namely a pure water ow nearly iso-
baric. Accordingly with the validity domain of the Berman solution,

The entire procedure starts with the setting of the entrance data.

Now we are ready to enter into the main axial loop. The procedure
described below is the same for all transverse section z = (n + 1)Dz
from n = 0 to N  1. For a general node n + 1 the above extrapolation
for 0 ≒
provides us with the initial guesses
j ≒ J.
At iteration k = 0, we use this guess for the transverse veloc-
ity by setting Uk=0 = (n+1)
. From the discretized form of Eq. (21),
and boundary nodes (symmetry condition at j = 0, and the Robin
boundary condition at j = J), we then obtain a tri-diagonal system to
inverse for computing the solute concentration prole C (n+1)

this is achieved when parameter a becomes as small as possible,
since the pressure drop is proportional to a2 . In Table 1, the numer-
ical data obtained with three studied cases where a rapidly declines
are gathered. Ep is the maximum of the relative error between the
numerical result (average permeate ux) and the solution of refer-
ence (here the Berman ow). It is clear that the departure diminishes
as the square of a2 , indicating that the error only comes from the
pressure drop, which induces a non-uniform ltration in the numer-
ical simulation. We retrieve the fact that pressure becomes uniform
as a2 diminishes, as well as permeation (according to Darcy＊s law).

For the sake of illustration, Fig. 3 shows the axial and transverse
velocity proles. Both numerical and analytical solutions (Berman
ow) are plotted for three axial sections, with no visible departures.

Fig. 3. Axial and transverse velocity proles obtained by numerical simulation compared to analytical solutions for a uniform permeation case (a = 0.01, Rin = 0.1, clean water):
correspond to symmetric channel (in Fig. 3a, note that both curves for z = 1 and vertical axis superimpose).

We observe that the axial velocity component is close to a parabola
(but slightly atter at the maximum). As expected, the analytical
solution well-predicts the velocity proles for low values of a . Let
us consider now increasing values of a , for a constant value of Rin ,
namely Rin = 0.05. This value corresponds to a typical situation
in RO/NF ltration; for example if we consider a system ltration
with a membrane resistance of I0 = 2.0 ℅ 1011 Pa  s/m operat-
ing at 100 bar. Varying pressure drop levels were tested: the rst
case concerns a negligible pressure drop (i.e. a = 0.01), the sec-
ond one considers an important pressure drop (a = 0.5) and nally
in the third case we test a predominant viscous pressure drop with
respect to trans-membrane pressure (a = 0.75). Table 2 summa-
rizes the dimensionless parameters of three tested cases in ※clean
water§ ltration. The inuence of parameters a and Rin is reected
in all panels of Figs. 4, 5, and6. Panels a and b illustrate reduced
axial and transverse velocity proles respectively for three differ-
ent positions of z coordinate and panels c and d plot streamlines,
reduced pressure p and reduced ow rate q along the channel until
a reduced axial distance from entrance z equals to 1. It should be
noticed that the reduced permeate velocity is implicitly included
since it is equal to the reduced pressure p according to Darcy＊s law
(Eq. (1)). As expected, the axial velocities (panel a) and axial owrates
(panel d) decrease along the membrane because of the permeate
ux passing through the membrane. However, when the local trans-
verse Reynolds number R0 is used instead of the inlet transverse
Reynolds number Rin , the Berman solution gives the right velocity
proles (panels a and b), even if it has been obtained for constant
ltration rates. Fig. 4 shows the case for a negligible inuence of pres-
sure drop (a = 0.01). The reduced pressure p is quietly constant in
that case (Fig. 4d), leading to a constant local permeate ux, which
does not depend on the axial position (Fig. 4b). Hence, the axial ow

q decreases linearly as seen in Fig. 4d. There is consequently a very
good agreement with the Berman＊s theory in this case, as expected.
For the second case, an important pressure drop was tested
(a = 0.5). The reduced pressure p decrease all along the channel
(Fig. 5d), leading to a decreasing local permeate ux (Fig. 5b). Then,
the axial owrate decreases more slowly than expected (Fig. 5d),
and the exhaustion length, z = 1, is reached without completely
exhausting the axial ow (Fig. 5c,d). As seen in Fig. 5d, the reduced
owrate q decreases faster than the reduced pressure p; hence, if
the channel would be longer, the axial ow exhaustion (AFE) would
occur rather than a cross-ow reversal (CFR). This is consistent with a
previous work [19] predicting this behavior for these values of a and
Rin (Rin ＞ 0, a < 1/
3).
If the relative pressure drop is further increased (a = 0.75), the
reduced pressure p will decrease faster than the owrate q, as seen
in Fig. 6d. At z = 0.8, the reduced pressure becomes negative (that
is, the pressure in the retentate side becomes lower than the pres-
sure in the permeate side), leading to a cross-ow reversal (CFR):
water ows from the permeate to the retentate, as expected for
Rin ＞ 0, a > 1/
3 [19]. Hence, the reduced axial owrate q increases
again for z > 0.8. Fig. 6 conrms us this behavior when streamlines
at z = 0.8 change direction passing through a process of suction to
injection.
To investigate the inuence of transverse Reynolds number Rin ,
other values of Rin (0.2, 0.5) that might correspond to ultraltration
(UF) or microltration (MF) systems have been evaluated; in both
cases the same behavior was found for the same values of parameter a .
Finally, let us consider the validation of the solute transfer cou-
pled with the uid motion. The solute concentration prole will fol-
low the exact analytical solution obtained by Haldenwang et al. [21],
if the following conditions are fullled: a) a vanishes (negligible
pressure drop to get the Berman ow); b) the exact solute bound-
ary layer and Berman ow are initiated at the duct entrance; c) the
recovery is low (i.e. the comparison is carried out for small k).
In Fig. 7, the concentration proles numerically computed, as
well as those corresponding to our analytic studies have been plot-
ted for four cases of increasing operating pressures (i.e. Pein ). As
expected, increasing operating pressures (i.e. increasing Pein ) leads
to higher permeate uxes and then to a more important concentra-
tion polarization. The discrepancy between the numerical and the
approximated analytical solution is hardly discernable in Fig. 7.

3.2. Comparisons with approximated approaches of the literature

Figs. 8 and 9 show the solute concentration at the wall and the
axial variation of the permeate ux, respectively. These gures con-
duct the comparisons between the results by Song and Elimelech
[50], TSB-plug[49] and TSB-shear [51] models described in Appendix
d = 0.35 mm with a membrane resistance I0 = 1 ℅11 Pa  s/m
(Subsection 5.3), with our numerical model for a RO module of height
supplying a solution of an initial concentration Cin = 5g/l and a
cross-ow rate Win = 0.1 m/s operating at different pressures Pin
ranging from 6 to 10 bar. This conditions correspond to the following
values of the characteristic dimensionless numbers: 0.0535 ≒ a ≒
0.0891, 0.370 ≒ Nosm ≒ 0.616, 2.10 ℅ 10 3 ≒ Rein ≒ 3.5 ℅ 10 3 ,
Sc = 621 and k > 1.
We remark that our numerical model predicts a strong devel-
opment of concentration polarization layer and a more rapid decay
of the permeate ux in the length very close to the entrance. This
prediction can be explained because with permeable walls, the trans-
verse advection strongly modies the layer construction, which is
no longer created by diffusion only. Our careful iterative process
allowed us to take account of this non-usual balance. Let us com-
pare our model with the TSB models. TSB models uncouple the axial

and transverse solute transfer, and its solute concentration prole
(Eq. (50)) is then atter than ours (Eq. (39)). Since the total salt con-
centration is conserved, the predicted wall solute concentration is
weaker than ours, and the local permeate ux is higher. If the mem-
brane is long enough, higher uxes in the TSB models lead nally
to higher solute concentrations, and their predicted local perme-
ate ux decreases then faster than ours for Z > 1 m. Recently, Liu
et al. [27] developed a TSB model considering a parabolic velocity
prole. Their results show an intermediate behavior between the
TSB-plug and the TSB-shear models with a concentration polariza-
tion more intense than predicted by the rst, but more attenuated
than predicted by the second. Hence, the comparison with the TSB-
parabolic model has not been tested, since the results of this model
would be found between those of the TSB-plug and the TSB-shear
model. When comparing our numerical model with the analytical
solution by Song-Elimelech, it can be seen that the Song-Elimelech
model predicts much higher local permeate uxes, and lower wall
solute concentrations. This is owed to the fact that Song-Elimelech
analytical solution considers a concentration polarization layer much
smaller than the channel height, which is not the case.
Figs. 10 and 11present the average permeate ux determined
by the TSB-shear model, the analytical solution and our numerical

model for the same ltration module of half-height d = 0.35 mm,
I0 = 1 ℅ 1011 Pa  s/m and for different operating conditions (oper-
ating pressures from 1 to 20 bar and inlet concentrations from 1.5 to
7 g/l). This conditions correspond to the following values of the char-
acteristic dimensionless numbers: 0.0267 ≒ a ≒ 0.535, Rein ≒
7 ℅ 10 3 , Sc = 621 and 5.54 ℅ 10 2 ≒ Nosm ≒ 9.24 ℅ 10 1 .
Comparison of the numerical and analytical solution shows good
agreement for low permeate uxes and short membranes (Fig. 10). It
should be kept in mind that the analytical model has been obtained
for high pressure (i.e. low values of alpha) and low recovery (i.e.
low values of lambda) conditions. When the inlet pressure Pin is
increased, the value of alpha decreases; however, lambda increases
the hypothesis of k (cid:7) 1 is not valid for high permeate uxes, which
at the same time, from 0.0286 for 1 bar to 0.571 for 20 bar. Hence,
explains the gap between the analytical and the numerical solutions.
The analytical solution overestimates the permeate ux because
it considers a constant transversal concentration prole (Eq. (39)),
whereas the numerical solution considers the more realistic develop-
ment of the concentration polarization from an homogeneous inlet
concentration at z = 0.
For long membranes (0.171 ≒ k ≒ 3.43, Fig. 11), the numerical
solution deviates from the analytical solution (even for low permeate

uxes), since the low recovery hypothesis is not valid. Considering
that recovery is low implies an underestimation of the solute con-
centration, an underestimation of the osmotic pressure and nally
an overestimation of the local permeate ux. Furthermore, as TMP
increases, the discrepancy between the analytical solution and both
numerical models is enhanced. This is of course due to the analytical
solution, the hypotheses of which are no longer fullled, as pressure
increases. More precisely, in Fig. 11, the channel length is large and
the hypothesis of low recovery becomes invalid, all the more so that
TMP produces a large permeation.
Comparison of our numerical solution with the TSB-plug model
shows a quite good agreement for long membranes (Fig. 11). For
short membranes (Fig. 10), the TSB model predicted higher values
than our numerical model; this trend was expected due to a major
inuence, in our numerical model, of the concentration polarization
development at the beginning of the process.

3.3. Comparisons with experimental data

At this point, we have demonstrated that the Prandtl approxi-
mation offers an accurate alternative with respect to the full con-
servation laws. We now need to validate the overall approach in

terms of basic choice with respect to the mathematical model. This
must be established by comparison with experiments. For the sake of
conducting this comparison, we choose different experimental con-
tributions that propose careful measurements in both NF and RO
measurements.
We rst compare our averaged permeate uxes as a func-
tion of the operating pressure with the experimental results
obtained by Geraldes et al. [18] in a NF module composed by a
1.4 ℅ 10 11m  s 1  Pa
CDNF501 commercial membrane with an hydraulic permeability of
1 , working at operating pressures that range
between 10 and 40 bar and for three feed axial rates. Even though
the NF module had a length of 20 cm, the reported data only included
average values obtained in the rst 6 cm. Table 3 allows the quan-
titative comparison between the data from the experiment and the
predictions of the numerical simulation for three aqueous solutions
of Na2 SO4 , sucrose and polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG1000). For
characterizing the physical properties of the chemical solution, we
recall that the numerical prediction only uses the standard constants
taken from the literature.

For both solutions with Na2 SO4 and sucrose, the comparison
between numerical and experimental results shows an excellent
agreement (a maximal relative error about 15 percent).
As for the PEG1000 solutions, our modeling overpredicts the per-
meation, in particular when the operating pressure is higher than 20
bar. When the feeding ow is increased (i.e. when the concentration
polarization is lesser), the discrepancy diminishes. As a matter of fact,
the Schmidt number of PEG1000 is very large and the polarization
at high pressure attains important values, in such a way that the
osmotic law increasing linearly with PEG1000 concentration can no
longer be appropriate. To conclude this stage of model validation,
the numerical predictions can be considered as reliable for both
solutions of Na2 SO4 and sucrose. For solutes of larger Schmidt num-
bers (as PEG1000), the polarization at high trans-membrane pressure
leads to very rich concentrations, for which the physical ※constants§
have to be modied.
We next turn towards a reverse osmosis experiment conducted
with salt. More precisely, we now compare two predictions (the TSB-
shear model and the present numerical model) with the experiments

of Zhou et al. [63]. This experiment presents a particular diculty for
our laminar simulation, since the ow is turbulent due to the effects
of spacers. Actually, an aqueous solution of NaCl feeds a set of four
spiral wound RO modules of a polyamide composite membrane (TFC
2540SW, Koch Membrane Systems). The pilot had a total length L of
4 m with a distance between membranes 2d of 0.6 mm, and a mem-
brane resistance I0 = 8.41 ℅ 1010 Pa  s/m. Experiments were carried
out with a mean inlet axial velocity Win = 0.075 m/s and for three
different feed initial concentrations Cin : 500, 1000 and 3000 mg/l.
To overcome the diculty due to the presence of turbulent mix-
ing, it was proposed in Zhou et al. [63] to adopt the concept of an
effective solute diffusivity, which is suggested at the value of D0 =
1.81 ℅ 10 8m2 /s, i.e. about ten times the molecular diffusion coef-
cient of sodium chloride. We hence have used the same turbulent
diffusivity in our numerical Prandtl approach. Numerical simulations

are depicted by solid lines, while TSB model results and experi-
mental data are plotted as dash-dotted lines and symbols, respec-
tively. For all cases both models agreed very well with experimental
uxes until a pressure of 10 bar but deviated gently as pressure still
increases. The maximum difference was about 15% for a feed con-
centration of 500 mg/l at a pressure of 15 bar. Actually, although
the simulations have considered a membrane which was 4 m long,
the experiments were carried out in 4 modules 1.016 m long con-
nected in series [63]. There is no permeate ux along the connection
pipes between the modules, thus reducing concentration polariza-
tion. This could explain the discrepancy between simulations and
experiments, especially for the highest trans-membrane pressures.
See Fig. 12.
We now conduct the last comparison of our numerical predic-
tions with experimental results. Measurements of the concentration
polarization prole are concerned. The experiment has been carried
out in Fern芍ndez-Sempere et al. [14] and consisted in measuring the
concentration polarization layer of a solution of Na2 SO4 within a RO
module by digital holographic interferometry. The module was com-
posed of a thin lm membrane (TFM-50, from Hydro Water S.L.) and
sized 10 cm ℅ 3 mm℅ 10 mm (L℅W℅H). In all three cases the operat-
ing pressure Pin was 7.2 bar and the feed initial concentration Cin was
8.5kg/m3 , for three different inlet mean velocities Win of 0.2, 0.7 and
1.7 cm/s. Unlike all the previous experimental results which consid-
ered two parallel permeable walls, these experiments were carried in
a channel with a permeable wall and an impermeable one. Hence, the
limit conditions for the axial velocity (Eq. (22)) have been modied:

w(0, z) = 0

(30)

Fig. 13 shows the concentration polarization proles obtained by our
numerical model and TSB model (solid and dotted lines, respectively)
compared with the experimental ones (symbols). Measurements were
performed at the distance from the inlet Z = 5 cm. A good agreement
is found between our numerical predictions and the experimental
data. We observe that the modeling slightly overestimates the con-
centration gradient (and hence the permeate ux). The same trend
in discrepancy also appears in Salcedo-Diaz et al. [44]. Here, we
can propose two possible explanations. First, our model considers

a total rejection by the membrane, although experiments showed a
97 % rejection for Na2 SO4 , only. Second, the experimental channel
has a width-to-height ratio of 3.3, and the consideration of a two-
dimensional geometry might be a slightly inaccurate approximation.
Lastly, the TSB model meets diculties in tting with the experimen-
tal concentration proles. This can partly be attributed to the fact that
the latter predictions have been obtained in the case of a symmetric
channel.
To nish this important stage of mathematical model validation
with respect to experiments, let us make the following remarks.
The Prandtl simulations, in a general manner, have shown an excel-
lent accordance with the analytical and numerical previous results,

and a good agreement with the experimental results. This point is
valid for both ※clean water§ ltration and coupling between hydro-
dynamics and mass transfer. Furthermore, the possible discrepancies
we have observed when comparing with experiments are likely to
be corrected by using concentration-dependent physical constants.
Such an improvement does not affect the present overall numerical
approach, and will be the object of future contributions. Another
remarkable point is that in all cases the ow always match locally
with a pattern that can be identied with the analytical solution
(i.e. Berman [7]). In other words, the ow pattern adapts to perme-
ation, while mass transfer rules the whole system (of course, the ow
plays an important role in mass transfer. . . ).

4. Conclusions and nal discussion

An ecient two dimensional numerical model has been devel-
oped; it solves the solute conservation equation coupled with the
steady Navier-Stokes equations under the Prandtl approximation.

This approach of cross-ow membrane ltration takes the pressure-
dependent leakage into account, as well as the effect of concen-
tration polarization on osmotic (counter-)effects in RO/NF ltration.
More precisely, the effective trans-membrane pressure depends
on osmotic effects due to concentration polarization at the mem-
brane. Under specic operating conditions, this numerical model
can predict the local permeate ux and the solute concentration
polarization with an excellent accuracy, as shown during the vali-
dation steps, where several exact analytical approaches were used
to validate the numerical model. Both local results of ow and
concentration elds were considered in this validation.
In comparison with other numerical approaches, our model pre-
dicts a rapid development of the polarization boundary layer and
hence a faster decline in permeation in the vicinity of entrance.
This prediction that differs from other numerical models might be
explained by the ability of the present model to accurately enforce
the non-linear boundary condition at the very entrance.

In the last section, we have compared our numerical predictions
with several RO/NF experimental results. A good accordance was
generally obtained. This validates the overall modeling approach,
from the choice of the model to the numerical solution method. It
is furthermore worthy of note that the present numerical tool can
be easily adapted to more sophisticate situations in terms of viscous
and transport properties. In the same vein, the numerical model can
be extended to other geometries, as tubular membranes, or to non-
linear laws on osmotic pressure, as realized in Lopes et al. [28]. In the
same manner, a model of membrane selectivity with partial solute
rejection can be considered as developed in Lopes et al. [29]. The
present numerical approach has easily been adapted to a situation of
fouling, a work which has been left to future publication.
Lastly, the ltration of multi-species systems (as in the case of
sea water desalination) can easily be envisaged from the present
work. For each species, a conservation law can be duplicated from the
present solute conservation law. Furthermore, an osmotic number
must be introduced for every species.

5. Appendix: a brief description of the models used for validation

5.1. The Berman ow

The Berman ow is a basis solution for the uid motion in a leaky
channel, when the permeation is uniform and xed all along the
porous walls [7]. Under this hypothesis, Berman derived the ow
solution {u(x, z), w(x; z)} to the steady Navier-Stokes equations com-
plemented with the lateral boundary conditions u(x = ㊣1, z) =
UW /Uin = ㊣1, as
u(x, z) =B(x ; Rin )
where B(x; in) is the solution of the ordinary differential equation
(ODE):

used in the validation step of our numerical approach. We shall par-
ticularly stress on the underlying assumptions making feasible the
analytical approach.

and Rin is the transverse Reynolds number of permeation. For the
standard congurations of ltration, a rich literature has shown that
the solution to ODE (Eq. (32)) is unique, stable and attractive in
the sense that, if the inlet conditions are different from the Berman
x-proles, Berman solution is recovered shortly after the entrance.

B. Bernales et al. / Desalination 404 (2017) 341每359

Moreover, in the range (i.e. Rin ≒ 4), the following Taylor expan-
sion of the Berman function rapidly converges (see for instance
Haldenwang [19]) in the standard situations of ltration:

(35)

The Berman ow for ltration only makes sense when the pressure
drop remains weak enough all along the channel, in order to justify
that the permeation is uniform. This condition corresponds to the
so-called assumption of ※high pressure§ (HP).

5.2. Exact analytical solution for mass transfer in Berman ow

In a previous study, Haldenwang et al. [21] obtained an exact ana-
lytical solution for the solute conservation law, when the carrying
ow is of Berman type. Let us now consider the solute mass conser-
vation law (Eq. (21)), in which we consider the velocity components
{u, w} as xed and given by expression (31) where the transverse
Reynolds number is unknown, since the permeation will depend on
the hindrance due to concentration polarization. Let us denote this
unknown permeation with U0 as the transverse velocity at the wall,
leading us to dene Re0 [resp. Pe0 ], the (unknown) Reynolds [resp.
P谷clet] number of permeation, as Re0 = q0U0 d/l 0 [resp. Pe0 =
U0 d/D0 ]. An exact solution to this problem has been established in
Haldenwang et al. [21] and reads:

Developing this solution (36) at the lowest order with respect to

expression for the solute concentration eld.

This relationship gives a mathematical form to the phenomenon of

(40)

Now, let us consider the osmotic pressure provoked by CW (z). To
maintain a uniform leakage, the osmotic pressure must be con-
stant all along the channel. Therefore, we must assume that (1 
z) ＞ 1. In other words, the channel length is limited enough to
keep the concentration polarization uniform all along the wall. This
condition corresponds to the so-called ※low recovery§ condition (LR).

Therefore, under the ※HP-LR§ assumption, concentration polarization
and permeation satisfy

ln[CW ] ＞ 5
8

Pe0

(41)

Then, expressing U0 accordingly with Darcy and Van＊t Hoff laws, we
get the ※three P谷clet number§ relationship:

is

Pein =

;

Peosm

(43)

Permeate ux U0 can be calculated from the last implicit Eq. (42)
in Pe0 by using an iterative method. This analytical approach is a
useful tool to estimate the permeation velocity U0 in presence of
polarization and osmotic effects. Finally, let us note that, in the limit
of the high operating pressures Pein (cid:10) 1, expression (42) reduces
to Pe0 ＞ 1.6ln
. The latter expression simply demon-
strates the classically observed saturation of the permeation when
increasing operating pressure.

5.3. Song-Elimelech model

Song and Elimelech [50] proposed to consider Eq. (21) under
various simplied forms, accordingly with the concerned zone. The
rst step in the assumption process consists in neglecting the sec-
ond term in the RHS of Eq. (21) (the mass axial transport) when
considering the domain in the very vicinity of the membrane. After
integration, this yields the dimensional form

U0 ( C  Cin ) = D0

d C
dX

(44)

where Cin is the feed solute concentration or bulk concentration. This
model assume that the concentration polarization layer is smaller
than the spacing of the membrane channel and considers at steady
state a mass balance relationship in the axial direction through the
channel:

where c is the shear rate, Z the axial distance from the entrance and

5.4. Total salt balance model with plug ow

This model takes into account that concentration polarization
layer could be developed to the whole height of the membrane
channel. Solute concentration at any transverse coordinate can be
determine by integrating Eq. (44)
C = Cin + ( Cm  Cin )
Pe0
exp( UX

)
(50)
D0
where Cm is the average solute concentration and Pe0 is the trans-
verse P谷clet number:

U0 d
Pe0 =
(51)
D0
We can consequently determine the wall concentration CW by eval-
uating Eq. (50) inX = 0:
CW = Cin + ( Cm  Cin )

(52)

Pe0
1  exp(Pe0 )

Considering that the total solute ux downstream along the channel
is constant even though both solute wall concentration and permeate
ux changed carried us to the following mass balance relationship:
CmWm = CinWin

(53)

where Win and Wm are the axial mean velocity at the entrance and
the axial mean velocity at any Z position respectively. Working with
an average axial velocity is equivalent to assume that the uid has
a constant axial velocity across the channel height (plug ow prole
in Fig. 14). From mass conservation principle for the solvent we can
establish the following relationship

dWm
=  U0
(54)

The variation of Cm along the membrane channel can be determine
by taking derivate of Eq. (53) with respect to Z and using Eq. (54) we
obtained:

A numerical method can solve Eqs. (55), (54), (2) and (52). Discretiz-
ing the membrane channel length L into n equal segments (DZ =
L/n), the nite difference forms of these equations are:

The iterative process begins when the feed solute concentration
Cin , the axial mean velocity at entrance Win and the driving pressure P
are given. The mean solute concentration Cm , the axial mean velocity
Wm , the permeate velocity U0 and the solute wall concentration CW ,
can be then obtained progressively throughout the entire membrane
channel using the nite difference equations above.

5.5. Total salt balance model with shear ow

In this model a shear ow rate c for axial velocity was considered,
as shown shear ow prole in Fig. 14 therefore the mass balance
relationship (Eq. (53)) along the cross-ow direction reads:

Let us nally remark that the models described above assume a con-
stant driving pressure P through the membrane channel. The vari-
ation in operating pressure is obtained by solving the uid motion.
In the latter case, to analytically study this more complex situation
is, to say the least, a hard task. Analytical developments for PDE are
never easy, especially when hydrodynamics is strongly coupled with
mass transfer equation. This is why a numerical approach seems to
be more suitable to analyze this situation.
