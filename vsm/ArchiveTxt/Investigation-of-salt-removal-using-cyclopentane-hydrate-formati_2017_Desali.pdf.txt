abstract

Salt removal via formation of gas hydrate was investigated by experimental measurement of the salt concentra-
tion in ltered water and water retrieved from hydrate crystals. Gas hydrate formation was carried out at
277.15 K, using seawater of 3.4 wt% salinity and 3 mol% cyclopentane to water-cyclopentane mixture. Single-
stage hydrate formation followed by ltration removed 63% of the salt ions. Successive washing treatment
with 274.15 and 277.15 K freshwater was applied with different amounts of washing water, and several major
cations and anions in seawater were analyzed in each treatment step. Ions having larger radii showed less salt
removal by hydrate formation, and salt removal decreased as the conversion of water to hydrate progressed.
However, salt removal was improved by washing treatment to nearly the same degree regardless of the kind
of salt ions and the salt removal efciency improved up to 42% more than that of ltration only. The results pre-
sented in this study can be used as basic design values for the development of a hydrate-based desalination
process.

1. Introduction

It has become increasingly difcult to secure safe sufcient water
because of the pollution of water resources and severe climate abnor-
malities resulting from explosive population growth and rapid industri-
alization. Securing abundant clean water serves social, economic, and
ecological interests; so a great variety of studies have been performed
to solve these problems [1]. From a technical point of view, to obtain
sufcient water of the quality desired, it is essential not only to conserve
and protect existing water but also to discover new water resources [2,
3]. Accordingly, a variety of desalination technologies has attracted the
interest of researchers because seawater is the largest water reserve on
Earth (97%), whereas only 0.5% of surface water on Earth is freshwater.
The problem with using seawater directly for daily life is that it contains
unacceptable levels of organic matter and salinity. Thus, desalination of
seawater is an obvious and good alternative to nding new source of
clean freshwater [3].
Existing reliable desalination methods at industrial scale are based
on either multi-stage thermal distillation or seawater reverse osmosis
(SWRO) ltration. Distillation is a prevailing method, but requires a
large amount of phase transition energy, that is the heat of vaporization
of water from liquid to vapor, so that it is quite expensive. SWRO meth-
od uses membrane to allow the selective transport of water along with
polymeric barrier at pressurized condition. Developing the materials for
membrane and energy recovery devices, reverse osmosis (RO) process
has dropped its energy consumption to around 3.0 kWh/m3-produced
water [4,5]. According to the literature [6,7], as of 2011, RO ltration
method is spreading out the market up to 66% of installed desalination
capacity, and nearly all new plants. However, this energy requirement
is still higher than other forms of water supply at 0.1 to 1 kWh/m3,
therefore much of efforts have been made on the development of hybrid
systems, such as RO with thermal process or renewable energy source,
for improving the economics aspect [8]. Pre-treatment for RO method
is another important step, due to the nature of membrane design, that
is, only one-way ow through membrane. Because the accumulated
material cannot be removed from the membrane surface, they easily be-
come fouling, which means loss of production capacity.
Freezing is another attractive method, but still not widely used
commercially. This method utilizes the phase change phenomenon of
water to solid ice crystal so that the coexisting ions and impurities are
excluded, and nally thawing produces puried water. Considering
the energy required to induce the phase change of water during boiling
(40.7 kJ/mol) and freezing (6.02 kJ/mol), seawater desalination by
freezing method is more advantageous. In addition, freezing desalina-
tion process has a low operating temperature, which minimizes scaling
and corrosion problems, and even inexpensive plastics or low cost ma-
terials can be used at low temperature [9]. Gas hydrate formation meth-
od for desalination could be one of the novel desalination processes,
which is also classied into a freezing, crystallization method. Because
of the additional chemicals called guest, such as gas/liquid hydrocar-
bons and CO2, gas hydrate forms at higher temperature than the freez-
ing point of ice, and this leads to an expectation of the improved energy
efciency [10,11]. The hydrate crystals form under suitable temperature
and pressure, and are collected to be dissociated by breaking the tem-
perature or pressure. In the next stage, the guest shall be recovered
from the dissociated water for further use, and freshwater is produced
[12]. Gas hydrate technology is still under development, but when ap-
plicable at larger scale, it could be a cheap alternative to the traditional
thermal and membrane desalination process [8]. Diminution in energy
consumption for water production is the main concern, so in this regard,
gas hydrate method as a pre-treatment step for RO process was tried to
investigate its feasibility by simulation study [13]. Pre-treated feed by
gas hydrate step would reduce the load of salt removal on RO process.
According to the report, 90% of salt removal efciency using CO2 hydrate
formation step and 0.80 of the subsequent RO recovery ratio with ener-
gy recovery device showed 2.74 kWh/m3 of total energy consumption,
which is able to compete with the SWRO system with energy recovery
device. In addition, the heat of hydrate formation is just 4.84 kJ/mol
(for cyclopentane hydrate [14]), thus the energy consumption could
be decreased further, comparing the enthalpies of the phase change.
The use of gas hydrates for desalination has been investigated during
the last 50 years, and a variety of hydrate formers and formation
methods were investigated to obtain improved kinetics and conversion
[4,15每18]. In most of the previous works, CO2 [19], light hydrocarbons
[20], and chlorouorocarbon refrigerants (e.g. R141b and R22
[21每23]) were tried as hydrate formers. However, they would require
relatively higher pressure for the operation. Recently, some researchers
tried to use cyclopentane as a hydrate former for the desalination pro-
cess because it forms solid hydrate crystals at atmospheric pressure
[24,25] and 280.95 K [26]. Moreover, cyclopentane is nearly immiscible
with water and shows extremely low mutual solubility. Therefore, it
could be recovered simply by decanting from the liquid-liquid phase
mixture after collecting and dissociating the hydrate crystals. Coral
et al. investigated the effect of the degree of subcooling, and of the
ratio of cyclopentane to water on the formation rate [24]. Like freezing
method, however, the water molecules containing salt ions are conned
within solid crystals of gas hydrate as well. Thus, subsequent post-
treatments are required. In our previous work, we investigated the for-
mation of cyclopentane hydrate in 3.5 wt% NaCl synthetic seawater and
observed the hydration number and conversion of water to hydrate
[26]. Optimal operation temperature and concentration of cyclopentane
were decided from the measured results. Post-treatment of hydrate
crystals (e.g., washing, centrifuging and sweating) was also tried in
efforts to enhance salt removal efciency, and we found that optimized
washing can be a promising candidate among possible post-treatments,
to raise the efciency of the hydrate-based desalination process.
In this work, the investigation was extended to an experimental
hydrate-based desalination process using cyclopentane with real sea-
water, and the effectiveness of washing method as post-treatment

was examined. While adopting the optimum temperature and concen-
tration of cyclopentane for hydrate formation, and ratio of washing
water to produced water, determined in our previous work, the effect
of a few anions and cations on the salt removal efciency in the pro-
posed process was investigated by analyzing the ion concentration in
ltered water, and in water retrieved after dissociating the hydrate par-
ticles. The salt removal efciency for each ion, and the proportion of
water converted to hydrate, the amount of wash water, and the feed
concentration were also examined.

2. Experiment

2.1. Materials

The seawater samples were obtained from the east cost of Jeju is-
land, Korea (33∼33∩47.3∪ North, 126∼,46∩26.2∪ East) and used as it was
without any further treatment. The seawater samples were analyzed
to obtain the ion concentration using ion chromatography. Results
from a detailed analysis of the concentrations of ions in the seawater
samples are presented in Table 1. The presence of other minor ions
was neglected. Cycopentane was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (98%
purity, reagent grade) and used as a hydrate former without further
treatment.

2.2. Apparatus

A round-bottomed two-necked ask was placed in a temperature
controlled cooling bath to be used as a hydrate crystallizer. A thermo-
couple was inserted into the aqueous solution to measure the tempera-
ture of the seawater during the experiments. The contents of the
hydrate crystallizer were stirred using a magnetic spin bar. An external
chiller was used to control the bath temperature. A vacuum-lter assay
device was used to lter the hydrate slurry, and a membrane lter was
applied to separate the hydrate crystals from the remaining liquid. A
vacuum oven was utilized to evaporate cyclopentane from the water
for mass analysis. A detailed description of the hydrate crystallizer and
post-treatment experiments was presented in our previous work [26].
The concentration of each ion was measured using ion chromatography
(Metrohm, 881 Compact IC pro) with an autosampler (Metrohm, 863
Compact Autosampler). Appropriate ion analysis columns were used
for cations (Metrohm, Metrosep C4) and anions (Shodex, IC 82904A).

2.3. Experimental procedure

To provide the primary cleaning treatment, the seawater samples
were passed through a lter paper to remove oating substances and
other particulate. Then, a mixture of seawater and cyclopentane was
placed in the hydrate crystallizer and well mixed by a magnetic spin
bar. In this experiment, the stirring rate of the spin bar was xed at
700 rpm for all the experiments. Next, the temperature of the contents
in the crystallizer was cooled to a specic experimental temperature.
After the system temperature became stable, a few small ice particles
were added to the crystallizer to induce the commencement of hydrate
nucleation. The temperature over time was recorded throughout the ex-
periment. As the cyclopentane hydrate particles formed, the crystallizer
was left as it was for about two hours to grow hydrate crystals. The tem-
perature increased for a moment because of the exothermic hydrate for-
mation reaction, but instantly reverted. At this point, the content of the

hydrate crystallizer was a slurry of hydrate particles and liquid
consisting of un-reacted water and cyclopentane. Then, the hydrate
slurry was separated into hydrate particles and remaining liquid by
the vacuum ltration using OMNIPORE membrane lters (Millipore,
10.0 ml JC). The ltered hydrate particles were subjected to further
washing using a specic amount of fresh water. Immersion of hydrate
particles into distilled water was expected to be an effective surface
cleaning method to remove the clinging salt ions to the hydrate particles
[26]. The washed hydrate particles were subjected to the vacuum ltra-
tion step again. In every step, the remaining liquid and dissociated
water from the hydrate particles were collected and analyzed, to obtain
the ion concentration. Finally, the removal efciency of each ion was
calculated from the measurement data using following equation.

where Co was the initial concentration of a specic salt ion in the feed,
and Cf was the nal concentration of the specic salt ion in the dissoci-
ated water from hydrate crystals.
There was unreacted or dissociated water and cyclopentane present
at each ltration and washing step, so that we had to measure the mass
and ion concentration in each samples to conrm the mass balance. Im-
miscible two-phase liquids consisting of water and cyclopentane were
separated carefully by decanting. A small amount of accompanying
cyclopentane in the water was removed by evaporation in an oven for
2 h, at 323.15 K. A more detailed description of this procedure can be
found in a previous report [26].

3. Results and discussion

In our previous work [26], the equilibrium dissociation temperature
of cyclopentane hydrate was determined to be 280.95 K for pure water,
and 279.75 K for 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution. We rst measured the
melting temperature of the cyclopentane hydrate in actual seawater
(salinity given in Table 1), and determined it to be 279.45 K. Based on
this temperature information, we performed experiments on hydrate
formation and washing at 274.15 and at 277.15 K, which provided
subcooling of 5.3 and 2.3 K, respectively. This means that the driving
force of this system became slightly less than that of the simulated sys-
tem although the experimental temperatures were the same. In addi-
tion, we used the same concentration of cyclopentane (3 mol%)
relative to the total moles of the water-and-cyclopentane mixture as
in our previous work, because it was found that the addition of 3 mol%
cyclopentane was suitable for the formation of hydrate slurry. Hydrate
of 3 mol% cyclopentane with seawater was formed at 277.15 K, and
the crystals were ltered and collected. A subsequent washing step
was done with 2 wt% portion of produced water at 274.15 and
277.15 K. The salt removal efciencies calculated from these results
are presented in Fig. 1. The hydrate formation and initial ltration
steps resulted in removal of 63% of the salt ions. Subsequent washing
with water at 274.15 and 277.15 K further increased the salt removal ef-
ciency to 72 and 83%, respectively. More salt ions were removed by
washing with water at 277.15 K than at 274.15 K. It seems that warmer
water affects the surfaces of the hydrate crystals, dissolving ions
adsorbed to the crystal surface. Of course, it should be considered that
washing with water of higher temperature would also decrease the
amount of hydrate crystals. We determined that washing crystals with
277.15 K water was most suitable for further treatment, so that all the
subsequent washing steps were done at 277.15 K.
During these experiments, each salt ion in seawater was measured
after each ltration and washing step. The removal efciencies of the re-
spective ions were calculated and presented in Fig. 2. As can be seen in
the gure, the ltration step was better at removing small ions and cat-
ions. Large anions were less well removed during hydrate formation
and ltration steps. However, after each washing step, the salt removal

efciencies did not show any distinctions related to the ion radius or
kind of ion. Nearly similar ion removal efciencies were obtained after
washing step. Park et al. reported the characteristics of cation removal
from seawater by gas hydrate formation method [27]. They used CO2
as a hydrate former and even made use of a newly developed apparatus
that could crystallize hydrate particles and simultaneously shape them
into pellets. From their results, it was found that the removal efciency
of each cation increased according to its ionic radius. Kang et al. also re-
ported the removal characteristics of cations and anions from seawater
hydrate using the apparatus of Park et al., with CO2 and CH4 as hydrate
formers [28]. After pelletizing, the hydrate particles were dried by wip-
ing the pellet surface with paper tissue. The use of CO2 as a former gave
better results than did CH4 for salt removal, and the removal efciency
of ions increased according to the ion radius, regardless of surface wash-
ing. Given that hydrate formation methods were different, and that our
results showed trends different from those in [27,28], we draw the con-
clusion that the adhesion characteristics of ions to the hydrate surface is
diverse, depending on the kind of ion and the hydrate former.
Here, it seems necessary to discuss the morphological difference of
hydrates formed from cyclopentane and those formed from gases.
Cyclopentane forms structure II hydrates, and the morphology of
cyclopentane hydrate is different from that gas formers such as CO2
and CH4 (structure I). In addition, the morphology of the crystals formed
has a signicant dependence on the degree of subcooling. As a general

trend, when the subcooling is ≡ 3.0 K, the shape of the hydrate crystals is
typically sword-like or in the form of triangular dendrites. When the
subcooling is 2.0每3.0 K, the crystal shape changes to a polygon of skele-
tal crystals, and when the subcooling is ≒ 2.0 K, the crystals are large
polygons with one side of polygon for the gaseous formers (e.g., CH4,
C2H6, C3H8 [29] or CO2 [30]). This trend does not change when applied
to an aqueous solution of salts. As for the hydrate formed from hydro-
phobic cylopentane in seawater, the crystal shape is hexagonal or
square at 1.4每4.5 K subcooling, and triangular for subcooling N 5.4 K
[31,32]. According to this information, the shape of the hydrate crystals
formed in Park et al. [27] and Kang et al. [28] would be dendritic, while
those formed in this work would be polygonal. Dendritic gas hydrate
crystals more easily contain water than polygonal crystals do, as long
as the hydrate crystal grows at a suitably low rate. This is because a
higher growth rate of hydrate crystal implies increased potential to in-
clude more water (and salt ions) among crystals. The salt removal ef-
ciency obtained in this work was about 83% after washing with 277.15 K
water, but that of CO2 hydrate reached nearly the same value when ex-
treme hydraulic pressure (≡ 70 kgf/cm2 [28]) was applied. The possibil-
ity of the emulsion formation for cyclopentane-water system should be
considered as a matter of course. Throughout these experiments, the
mixture of water and cyclopentane formed an oil-in-water emulsion
at rst; then the hydrate slurry formed as the temperature cooled
down to initial temperature. Due to the formation of an emulsion, it
may be possible that the cyclopentane is entrapped inside the formed
crystals [14]. Accordingly, when the crystal is dissociated to retrieve
the produced water, the emulsion can form again, and cyclopentane
can be recovered in small drops as well. In future work, a well-
developed method for the dispersion of water and cyclopentane should
be devised to avoid this situation.
Fig. 3 shows a scatterplot with regression line, of the salt removal ef-
ciency after ltration of hydrate crystals according to the conversion of
water to cyclopentane hydrate, reacting at 277.15 K with 3 mol% of
cyclopentane. Cyclopentane hydrate can contain 17 mol of water per
mole of cyclopentane to form a structure II hydrate, so the theoretical
conversion of water to hydrate becomes 52.58%. As can be seen in the
gure, the salt removal efciency declined as the conversion increased.
Even though the temperature difference was xed at 2.3 K, the stochas-
tic nature of crystallization resulted in scattered conversion values from
41.2 to 53.3%, and the corresponding salt removal efciency also varied
from 53.7 to 70.8%. The average conversion and salt removal efciency
were 51% and 63%, respectively. Because we previously found that
post-treatment by washing makes it possible to decrease the salt re-
moval efciency, there is no need to worry about the inclusion or

adhesion of salt ions to hydrate crystals during hydrate formation. Con-
version of water to cyclopentane hydrate is relevant not only to the con-
centration ratio of cyclopentane to water and to the degree of
subcooling, but also to the reaction time, reactor shape, and so forth.
As mentioned above, we xed the ratio of cyclopentane to water, the
degree of subcooling, and reaction time according to the results from
our previous work. Accordingly, we would like to discuss briey the re-
actor here. When a large scale desalination process using hydrate for-
mation is to be actualized, the amount of hydrate slurry with a high
concentration of hydrate crystals should be increased as much as possi-
ble for the best productivity. To accomplish this goal, the ratio of
cyclopentane to water, degree of subcooling, and the reaction time
had better be increased. However, we already found in our previous
study that the suitably adjusted values of each parameter resulted in
better salt removal efciency.
A continuously stirred tank reactor with mechanical stirring is gen-
erally employed for hydrate production. Stirring is an important
means to obtain better mass contact between water and the gas for-
mers. However, in this work, immiscible cyclopentane formed a two
liquid-phase mixture and even an emulsion with water when stirred.
A large amount of hydrate slurry with high conversion could be obtain-
ed easily in a comparatively short time by using a dispersion tool such as
a homogenizer. Compared to ordinary mechanical mixing, a dispersion
homogenizer would seem more effective for emulsifying cyclopentane
and water. Highly dispersed cyclopentane in water forms a ne emul-
sion, and this should make it possible to achieve a higher conversion
to hydrate crystals. This shape of reactor can increase the rate of hydrate
formation, but it is expected that its salt removal efciency will not be
good, according to Fig. 3. Although post-treatment of washing mitigates
the effect of inclusion or adhesion of salt ions to hydrate crystals, the
amount of wash water and the details of washing (method and equip-
ment) should be deliberated. In other experiments, we found that this
type of reactor system does not promote favorable salt removal efcien-
cy, even after washing, when compared to the results using a more typ-
ical mixing type reactor. It seems that a carefully developed unique
reactor is required to accomplish rapid, large scale production of hy-
drate slurry. We have begun investigations on the characteristics of
cyclopentane hydrate production according to the reactor type, and
will present these ndings in a later report.
We also investigated the salt removal efciency of washing treat-
ment according to the amount of washing water. After hydrate forma-
tion with 3 mol% cyclopentane at 277.15 K, the slurry was ltered, and
then the collected hydrate crystals were washed using fresh water of
which the amount was varied according to a specic ratio of wash
water to produced water. The results presented in Fig. 4 show that

hydrate crystals are cleaned by washing with water. Moreover, the salt
removal efciency was extremely enhanced (up to 90%, 42% improved
from ltering only case), compared to that of ltration only. However,
the increase in efciency increase nearly ceases when wash/produced
water ratio exceeds 0.035. Thus, to maximize the efciency of the wash-
ing treatment, an appropriately chosen amount of washing water
should be applied. This optimal ratio of wash water to produced water
is likely to be near 0.03. In general, the amount of wash water should
be at most a few percent of the total produced water [33]. Large scale
hydrate slurry production with efcient washing should be done to re-
alize a competitive desalination process. For this purpose, equipment
suitable for production should take into account the size and type of re-
actor and lters. In particular, a lter system should be designed that en-
ables the continuous operation with the smallest amount of wash water
possible. There are several types of lter systems that can be operated in
continuous operation (e.g., rotary vacuum-drum, belt), and other self-
cleaning mechanical aids. When selecting the best ltration system
from among the candidates, our experimental data could provide im-
portant criteria for the decision.
Although the cyclopentane hydrate formation method removes 63%
of salt ions (up to 90% with successive washing treatment step), this
level of salt removal value is not acceptable for the nal goal of seawater
desalination, namely acquiring potable water. As reported in the recent
literatures [24每28], the salt removal efciencies reported for gas hy-
drate formation method ranged from 60% to 93%, depending on the
kind of gas hydrate former and post-treatment condition. Therefore, an-
other post-process to complete salt removal is required when the hy-
drate formation method is applied to obtain drinking water through
seawater desalination. Recent trend is to combine methods as hybrid,
as mentioned in the Introduction section. Lee et al. [13] carried out the
simulation of a reverse osmosis desalination process coupled with a hy-
drate formation method as a pre-treatment step for reverse osmosis
process. According to their result, the gas hydrate formation method
as a pre-treatment step is acceptable for a reverse osmosis process if
the salt removal efciency of the gas hydrate process can reach 78% at
least. They used energy consumption value as an important criterion
for the allowance, so that the economic efciency of the reverse osmosis
desalination process would be improved further, if the energy con-
sumption in the hydrate formation step could be reduced more. To be
a competitive desalination process, total energy consumption should
be maintained below 3.0 kWh/m3 and this could be accomplished
when the gas hydrate pre-treatment step is operated at 84% of salt re-
moval (1.6 kWh/m3). The energy consumption by gas hydrate process
is reported above 1.58 kWh/m3 {Javanmardi:2003gd}. The principal
reason for energy consumption in the gas hydrate formation method
is attributed to the compression need to achieve the conditions suitable
for gas hydrate formation. However, liquid cyclopentane can remove
this requirement so that the energy consumption is markedly
diminished. Another important point is the operation temperature.
Considering the seawater temperature, the most favorable operation
temperature is as close as possible to room temperature. Gas hydrate
formation generally requires relatively low temperature, which is an-
other shortcoming. To overcome this disadvantage, Cha and Seol
{Cha:2013dc} introduced a secondary hydrate former (CO2 gas) so
that the operation temperature could be increased to 289.15 K, although
the operation pressure remained high (up to 3.0 MPa). In addition, the
hydrate formation method could be another meaningful position as a
pre-treatment step for RO process. As mentioned before, RO process is
susceptible to the feed condition, such as the salinity and solids within
water, but on the other hand, gas hydrate method is relatively robust
to such condition. Rejection of salt and oating solids by gas hydrate for-
mation at a certain level could make the RO process solid and reliable
much more. Therefore, it is worthwhile to carry out the overall simula-
tion of a desalination process using gas hydrate formation as a pre-
treatment followed by reverse osmosis, considering the operation con-
ditions in detail. Nevertheless, the gas hydrate formation process could

also be a promising method for recovery or purication of water pollut-
ed during oil and natural gas production or of industrial wastewater.

4. Conclusion

A hydrate-based desalination process involving hydrate crystal for-
mation, ltration, and water washing steps was investigated to clarify
detailed salt ion removal efciencies in detail. A single-step hydrate for-
mation reaction of cyclopentane and seawater without any further
treatment was carried out at 277.15 K (corresponding subcooling was
2.3 K), 3 mol% cyclopentane, and atmospheric pressure. The total salin-
ity of the seawater was 3.4%, and about 63% of the salt ions were re-
moved by hydrate formation and ltration. The concentration of each
cation and anion was analyzed in ltered water and water retrieved
from the hydrate crystals, from which the removal efciency of each
salt ion was calculated. To improve removal of salt inclusions in the
crystals, or salt adhered to the crystal surfaces; a wash treatment of
277.15 K freshwater was applied after ltration. This washing increased
the salt removal efciency as much as 42%, compared to the result from
ltration only, and all of the cations and anions considered in this study
were removed at similar levels. The relationship between the salt re-
moval efciency and water conversion to hydrate was also investigated.
As the conversion of water to hydrate increased up to the theoretical
limit, the salt removal efciency decreased by about 15%. Accordingly,
it seems that higher conversion is not good from the point of view of
salt removal. However, the successive washing treatment was able to
eliminate this concern so that large scale production of cyclopentane
hydrate slurry using an appropriate reactor may soon be considered.
The efcacy of the amount of wash water used in the washing treatment
was also investigated in relation to the salt removal efciency. The salt
removal efciency increased as much as 42% when washing was ap-
plied, compared to hydrate formation and ltration, and considering
the amount of wash water. It is expected that the experimental data
presented in this study will be useful as basic design parameters when
the hydrate-based desalination method is embodied into a concrete
process. Study on the most effective reactor design and ltration meth-
od, as well as simulation of the overall process, is currently under
investigation.
