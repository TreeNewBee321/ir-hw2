abstract

The purpose of this paper is to examine stability and originate stability criteria for nonlinear digital sys- 
tems under the inuence of saturation overow, both in the absence and presence of external interfer- 
ence. The developed approaches can be employed to analyse overow oscillation-free implementation 
of a nonlinear digital system under saturation overow nonlinearity, caused by the nite word-length 
limitation of a digital hardware, such as computer processor or micro-controller. Asymptotic stability is 
examined in the absence of disturbance, whereas in the presence of external interference, the form of 
stability ensured is uniformly ultimately bounded stability, in which the states trajectories converge to an 
ellipsoidal region around the origin. In most of the studies reported so far, the authors have performed 
the overow stability analysis of linear systems but very little (if any) work has been reported on the 
overow oscillation elimination (for nonlinear systems). In the present work, sector conditions derived 
from saturation constraint along with Lipschitz condition are used with a suitable Lyapunov function for 
the stability analysis of nonlinear digital systems under overow. The validity and ecacy of these crite- 
ria are tested by using examples from real nonlinear physical systems, including Moon chaotic system¡¯s 
observer and recurrent neural network.

1. Introduction 

An electrical signal, having specic magnitude and frequency, 
can be processed by a digital lter to suppress the noisy com- 
ponents. There are many applications of digital lters, such as 
speech signal processing, digital image processing, medical elec- 
tronics, geophysics, seismographic data processing, thermal pro- 
cesses, heating water stream, communication, defense, and spec- 
trum and vibration analyses [1¨C3] and [4¨C6] . Implementation of 
digital systems in hardware causes problems due to nite word- 
length limitation of the hardware that can result into overow os- 
cillations, limit cycles, instabilities and performance degradation. 
This highlights the signicance of analysis and design of digi- 
tal systems under the repercussions of overow and quantization 
nonlinearities [7¨C12] (see also the works in [13¨C18] ). It may be 
noted that decoupling of overow and quantization effects can be 
achieved if the number of quantization steps is suciently large 
[13,14,19] . Moreover, several low order digital lter units are gen- 
erally cascaded to realize a high order digital lter, prompting mu- 
tual interference problem, that may lead to performance degrada- 
tion and even complete failure of the digital lter [1] . 
Many studies have discussed the elimination of overow os- 
cillations in linear digital lters and systems such as [20¨C30] . In 
[20] , zero-input overow oscillation elimination analysis has been 
reported for arbitrary order lossless digital integrators and differ- 
entiators, provided certain conditions are satised. Stability criteria 
development for the elimination of overow oscillations for direct- 
form digital lters, in the presence of saturation overow, has been 
dealt with, in the work [21] , which proclaims the global asymp- 
totic stability of the states of a lter. The criterion presented in 
[24] also deals with the global stability in the presence of sat- 
uration overow nonlinearity. However, compared to [21] , xed- 
point state-space digital lters with zero-input have been consid- 
ered and structural properties of multiple saturation nonlinearities 
are investigated in [24] . The paper [22] presents a criterion for

disturbance elimination, which guarantees exponential and robust 
stability for the linear digital systems with saturation arithmetic in 
the absence and presence of external interference. The results in 
[23,26] incorporate the impact of different combinations of over- 
ow and quantization nonlinearities for the global asymptotic sta- 
bility of xed-point state-space digital lters. 
The research paper in [25] presents a less conservative and 
multi-bound-dependent stability criterion that includes bound- 
dependent delay under overow constraint for the xed-point 
state-space digital systems. In the work [27] , a new criteria for 
the externally interfered and saturation overow affected direct- 
form digital lters to ensure input or output to state stability has 
been developed, which also guarantees output to state stability and 
asymptotic stability in the absence of disturbance. A dissipativity 
criterion has been established for the externally interfered xed- 
point digital lters under overow nonlinearity in [28] , which in- 
troduces 
 passivity and mixed 
 /passivity performances in a 
combined structure. Recently, in [30] one-dimensional (1-D) dig- 
ital lter¡¯s local stability has been investigated, under overow 
constraint, by developing LMI-based stability criteria while utiliz- 
ing the local saturation arithmetic. One of these criteria is a lo- 
cal asymptotic stability criterion, considering zero external distur- 
bance, and the other one is an 
 criterion for analyzing external 
interferences rejection performance. Global stability analysis has 
been treated as a special case of the presented local stability anal- 
ysis in the same work. 
Linear two-dimensional (2-D) systems [31] under overow and 
external interferences form the subject matter of the works [32¨C
36] , with the noise assumed to be deterministic in [33,34] . For 
the local state-space (LSS) Fornasini¨CMarchesini modeled two- 
dimensional digital lters, new criteria for the global asymptotic 
overow stability have been established in [32] , which are less 
conservative than the previously cited works. The approach of 
[33] actually considers the effect of both quantization and over- 
ow nonlinearities for the 2-D lter case. Another work on stability 
analysis of the digital systems under overow function in [35] con- 
siders the Wiener-type stochastic external noise for the stability in- 
vestigation, which is more realistic than the case of deterministic 
perturbations. In another work, [36] , the proposed stability crite- 
rion to eliminate overow oscillations, can be deployed for linear 
parameter varying time-variant digital lters, considering overow 
effects, and disturbance in states and output of the system. The 
same criterion in [36] , certies both, the overow stability in ab- 
sence of input, and 
 performance. In [29] , two new criteria have 
been established for input to state stability, by utilizing the input- 
output information, for xed-point state-space and direct form dig- 
ital lters by considering the effects of external interference. 
It has been observed that most of the available literature, in- 
cluding the above-mentioned works, addresses the stability anal- 
ysis of linear digital systems in the presence of overow con- 
straint. Even if stability analysis of nonlinear digital systems is dis- 
cussed, the effects of overow are not incorporated [37¨C41] . There 
are many examples of nonlinear digital systems implemented on a 
hardware like a computer processor, eld-programmable gate array 
(FPGA), digital signal processing (DSP) kits or a micro-controller 
for signal processing, control and communication applications by 
considering the hardware constraints as observed in the litera- 
ture [42¨C44] . For instance, observer or state lter for the nonlin- 
ear systems [45] are also nonlinear, which are implemented digi- 
tally. Similarly, digital controllers for nonlinear systems [46] used 
to regulate the behavior by taking advantages of the digital tech- 
nology are also nonlinear. Neural networks, implemented in digi- 
tal hardware, contain nonlinear components [47] , which are em- 
ployed for several ltering, control, image processing, and pattern 
recognition applications. Adaptive systems and controllers are also 
inherently nonlinear, therefore, their digital implementation con-

stitutes a nonlinear digital system [48] . Another example of non- 
linear digital system is controller for feedback linearization [49] . 
Recursive least square (RLS) algorithm can also be referred to as 
a nonlinear digital system which can be realized in a digital hard- 
ware [50] . Practically, digital nonlinear systems hold a great deal of 
importance, and therefore, stability analysis for these systems is an 
important task in the presence of overow, which is inevitable in 
any digital hardware, and also in the presence of inescapable ex- 
ternal interferences. However, this non-trivial problem of stability 
analysis of nonlinear digital systems subject to the hardware over- 
ow constraints, having remarkable practical importance, is not ev- 
idently addressed in the previous methods. 
This research work focuses on the development of overow sta- 
bility criteria for (xed-point) Lipschitz nonlinear systems in the 
absence or presence of external perturbations to examine overow 
oscillation-free implementation of the digital system on a com- 
puter processor, FPGA, DSP kits or a micro-controller. Stability con- 
ditions have been derived using the Lyapunov theory along with 
the sector condition attained from the saturation nonlinearity and 
the Lipschitz condition. These stability criteria have been presented 
in form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which offers computa- 
tional convenience for the stability analysis. In the absence of the 
external interferences, the proposed criterion can be used to anal- 
yse asymptotic stability of the nonlinear digital system under over- 
ow. Furthermore, a condition for external interference attenuation 
analysis of the nonlinear digital system with the saturation-type 
overow has been provided, which ensures convergence of the sys- 
tem¡¯s states into an ellipsoidal region. 
In contrast to the previous works on the stability analysis of 
the digital systems (or lters) under overow constraint (like [20¨C
30,32¨C36] ), the effects of both the overow nonlinearity and the 
nonlinear dynamical digital component have been studied while 
acquiring the stability conditions for the nonlinear digital systems 
for consideration of hardware implementation. The present work 
addresses a fundamental and inaugural problem of the stability 
analysis of the digital systems with hardware constraints and in- 
herent nonlinear complexity. Therefore, the proposed approach can 
handle the nonlinear ltering algorithms and can also be readily 
applied to the linear counterpart as a specic case. In addition, the 
resultant analysis conditions can be applied to the nonlinear digital 
systems under overow nonlinearity in the presence of bounded 
external interferences to attain an idea of the external interfer- 
ences attenuation level of a lter. The stability criteria have been 
applied to the overow oscillation elimination analysis of two non- 
linear physical systems, including state lter for the observer of 
Moon chaotic system and recurrent neural network (RNN) and the 
solutions attained are provided to depict validity of the proposed 
approaches. 
The organization of the remaining paper is as follows: 
Section 2 presents the general structure of the concerned digital 
system and associated assumptions. Detailed stability analysis for 
the nonlinear digital systems, without disturbance, and representa- 
tion of the nal results in form of LMIs are provided in Section 3 . 
The results are extended in Section 4 to consider the external dis- 
turbance. The proposed methods have been employed for overow 
stability analysis of two physical nonlinear systems and the re- 
sults are presented in Section 5 . Finally, conclusions are drawn in 
Section 6 .

When a system is implemented in a digital hardware like a pro- 
cessor, DSP kits or a micro-controller, overow of the states occur 
(due to nite word-length effect) may cause severe performance 
degradation. For the present case, the nonlinear digital system 
given by (1) ¨C(2) is considered under the effect of saturation over- 
ow. A large number of digital systems contain nonlinear compo- 
nents and examples of such systems include digital state-space l- 
ters, neural networks, adaptive systems, controllers and observers.

Remark 1. Assumption 1, well-known as the Lipschitz condition, 
is a property used to ensure continuity of a function g(
(k 
))
 . This 
condition can be validated for all differentiable functions; there- 
fore, a large number of the digital systems satises this condition. 
It is required to ensure well-posedness of a digital system like (1) ¨C
(2) . If Assumption 1 is validated, a nonlinear digital system of type 
(1) ¨C(2) can be smoothly implemented via digital technologies.

(5) 

The present study assumes that the value of tolerable bound on 
the amplitude of external interference, in the form of 
¦Ä , is known 
a priori for the stability analysis. In most of the cases, a guess 
of the worst case amplitude of external perturbations is available, 
¦Ä can be obtained. Based on the value 
through which an idea of 
¦Ä , our approach aims to provide an estimate of the region in 
of 
which state of the nonlinear digital lter converges. If the value of 
¦Ä is unknown, we can still obtain the stability information; how- 
ever, estimate of the region cannot be obtained. 

Remark 2. Most of the existing research work has been accom- 
plished to devise stability criteria for the linear digital systems un- 
der overow in the presence or absence of external interferences 
[20¨C24] (see also [25¨C30,32¨C36] ). These existing works have ig- 
nored the presence of any nonlinearity in a digital system. In the 
present work, we have incorporated a nonlinear function g( x (k), 
which satises the Lipschitz condition in Assumption 1. Time- 
derivatives of many nonlinearities have bounded values, which sat- 
isfy the Lipschitz condition. Therefore, Assumption 1 is valid for a 

large number of digital systems since most of the nonlinearities are 
either globally or locally Lipschitz and satisfy the inequality (4) . 

The following sector condition is obtained from the saturation 
condition (3) :

The condition (6) can be employed to derive the stability investiga- 
tion criteria for the nonlinear system (1) ¨C(2) , under overow. The 
aim of this research is to develop a criterion to study asymptotic 
stability for a nonlinear digital system under saturation overow 
constraint in the absence of external interference. Another criterion 
will be developed for the system (1) ¨C(2) to examine uniformly ul- 
timately bounded stability in the presence of external disturbances. 

3. Stability analysis for nonlinear digital system 

In this section, a criterion for the asymptotic stability is estab- 
lished for nonlinear digital systems without external interferences 
under overow nonlinearity.

Remark 3. A large number of digital systems, like state lters, tun- 
able lters, observers, estimators, controllers, adaptive systems and 
neural networks, are inherently nonlinear. The problem of stabil- 
ity analysis of these nonlinear systems under any form of over- 
ow arithmetic is rarely addressed in literature. Therefore, the cri- 
teria developed in the previous papers, like [20¨C30,32¨C36] , work 
only for the linear systems, and may not guarantee overow con- 
sequences elimination under nonlinear dynamics. In contrast, the 
proposed criterion (7) in Theorem 1 investigates asymptotic stabil- 
ity for the nonlinear systems by considering the nonlinear dynam- 
ics under saturation overow caused by nite word-length limita- 
tion of digital technologies and can be effectively employed for the 

M. Umair Amjad et al. / Signal Processing 140 (2017) 139¨C148 

143 

consideration of implementation of complex digital systems and 
algorithms. 

Remark 4. It should be noted that derivation of a stability con- 
dition for the nonlinear digital systems under an overow non- 
linearity, such as in Theorem 1 , is a non-trivial research problem. 
Mainly, the digital system (1) ¨C(2) contains two nonlinearities: an 
overow nonlinearity and an inherently present dynamical nonlin- 
earity. Further complexity arises since the dynamical nonlinearity 
g(
(k 
)
 is nested in f (
(k 
))
(k 
)
(k 
)
 g(
(k 
))
 as y 
 Ax 
 . These nested 
nonlinearities form a complex nonlinear function, which has been 
addressed in the present study for overow oscillation elimination 
analysis for dealing hardware implementation issues.

4. Extension to external interference rejection 

In this section, we address establishment of a criterion for the 
uniformly ultimately bounded stability of nonlinear digital sys- 
tems in the presence of external interferences (caused by electro- 
magnetic interference of cascade structures) and overow nonlin- 
earity (due to nite-word length issue of a digital hardware). Uni- 
formly ultimately bounded stability applies to the systems with 
amplitude-bounded disturbances and provides a bound on the am- 
plitude of the state of the lter. In most of the cases, the am- 
plitudes of disturbances, noises and perturbations are bounded; 
therefore, the uniformly ultimately bounded stability can be a suit- 
able choice for the dynamical systems.

Remark 5. Digital systems and algorithms are affected by distur- 
bances and perturbations when implemented on a hardware. Many 
practical applications require multiple cascade stages of digital l- 
ters, which are inuenced by interferences from different stages. 
These external perturbations may cause severe performance degra- 
dation of the digital systems in the presence of overow and dy- 
namical nonlinearities. The approach presented in Theorem 1 can- 
not be used to analyse overow effects elimination of digital l- 
ters under external perturbations. Consequently, the proposed ap- 
proach in Theorem 2 is derived to study the ability of a digital l- 
ter to deal with the disturbances in addition to overow and lter 
nonlinearities. The later methodology ensures uniformly ultimately 
bounded stability, rather than asymptotic stability, of a lter sub- 
jected to unwanted signals. 

Remark 6. The approach provided in Theorem 2 investigates uni- 
formly ultimately bounded stability of a digital system (1) ¨C(2) un- 
der external perturbations by examining the convergence of the l- 
¡Ü 1 . To esti-

(k 
)

 which can 
(S 
be achieved through minimization of 
¡Ý ¦Æ I and 
 . Therefore, ad- 
ditional constraints of S

Theorem 2 and 
¦Æ can be maximized through convex LMI routines,

(S

 . Consequently, the matrices

(k 
)
R and S can be employed to attain a small region 
 Sx 
in which the states of the lter converge. In addition, the values 
of R and S can be selected through convex routines to attain the 
feasibility of the constraints in Theorem 2 .

through the diagonally dominant matrices based approach pre- 
sented in [51] . For instance, the scalars 
, 
, 
, and 
can be 
replaced with the diagonally dominant positive-denite matrices 
 4 to improve the results for feasibility. Let l (

The proof can be easily followed by application of the approach 
in [51] to the proposed results of Theorem 2 ; therefore, it is left for 
the readers. To ensure matrices 
 and 
 4 as diagonally 
dominant, the same approaches provided in [51] can be adopted 
by employing additional constraints. Compared to the approach in 
Theorem 2 , the methodology developed in Theorem 3 has more 
computational complexity; however, it can be readily employed to 
address the infeasibility issue of Theorem 2 and can be used to 
attain less conservative performance estimates than Theorem 2 . 
The present study explored stability of the digital systems un- 
der inherent complexity and overow nonlinearity by considering 
a nonlinear model with xed parameters. Often, we encounter dig- 
ital lters and systems with varying parameters due to adaptive, 
switching and fuzzy nature of the models as observed in the meth- 
ods [52¨C57] . Consequently, future work is needed to investigate 
stability of the nonlinear digital systems of varying co-ecient ma- 
trices under external interferences and nite word-length effects.

5. Simulation results 

This section provides numerical simulation results for overow 
stability analysis of two nonlinear digital systems including an ob- 
server for a Moon system [58] and recurrent neural network (RNN) 
[59] . 

5.1. Example 1: observer for Moon system 

Moon system is a physical system, comprising of a pendulum 
attached to a bracket, which has some exibility. There is a metal 
ball attached at the end of the pendulum, and two magnets are 
xed around the pendulum, which are at equal distance from it 
when the overall system of pendulum and bracket is not moving. A 
harmonic oscillatory movement is utilized, which has constant am- 
plitude, to excite the bracket and drag the pendulum into motion 
[58] . Consider a Moon chaotic system, which has been discretized 
using Euler¡¯s method, as

where x p 1

the stimulation applied to the system, m is the mass of the metal 
ball, and T is the sampling time. With m

 chaotic behav- 
ior is evinced by the system. In [58] , an observer for the Moon 
chaotic system has been developed for the state ltering purpose. 
The equations for the observer of the system (29) ¨C(31) are given

In this work, the zero-input stability is being investigated for 
nonlinear systems without disturbance and with disturbance by 
selecting T 
 1 sec. Therefore, the input to the digital ltering sys- 
tem is considered to be zero, that is, u F 
 0 . The observer (35) ¨C
(36) , for the system (29) ¨C(31) is nonlinear and it can be imple- 
mented via a digital hardware. Eventually, this can inevitably cause 
¡¤) and the external perturbation w 
the overow f ( 
(k

 effects. Hence, 
the equation (37) with u F 
 overow nonlinearity and external 
perturbations becomes

The conventional approaches like [20¨C30] fail in this example 
due to presence of a nonlinearity in the observer; however, the so- 
lution to the LMI (7) is feasible. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
the proposed criterion, presented in Theorem 1 , can be successfully 
used to analyze the asymptotic stability of a nonlinear digital sys- 
tem, in the absence of external interferences. 

5.1.2. With external interference 
Now, the stability criterion given by LMI (23) in Theorem 2 is 
applied to the Moon chaotic system observer (29), (30) , and (31) .

As the solution to the LMI (23) is feasible, the lter is stable un- 
der external perturbations. Our methodology of Theorem 2 is con- 
venient to examine the uniformly ultimately bounded stability of 
a nonlinear digital system subject to external interference. In an- 
other experiment, the lter¡¯s state x have been plotted for the ob- 
server of Moon chaotic system with four different initial states, un- 
der the disturbance which has been assumed to be uniformly dis-

tributed random vector, w 
 [0 
 where w 1 
, and 
are Gaussian random variables of mean zero and unity vari- 
ance, as shown in Fig. 1 by considering the optimization stated 
in Remark 6 . It is evident that all of the state trajectories are 
¡Ü 1 
converging to the ellipsoidal region specied by 
¦Çx 
)
 Sx 
(k 
)
around the origin as anticipated from the criterion presented in 
Theorem 2 . 
It is worth mentioning that the stability of the nonlinear dig- 
ital systems under overow, such as the digital state observer 
given by (35) ¨C(36) , can be analyzed through the proposed criteria 
(7) and (23) , the existing methods [20¨C30] (see also [32¨C36] ) fail 
to study stability for the nonlinear digital systems under overow 
constraint in the absence or presence of external interferences.

5.2. Example 2: Recurrent neural network 

Articial neural networks (ANN), similar to the biological neu- 
rons, process information in parallel disseminated way [60] . How- 
ever feed-forward neural networks (FNN) have limitation that 
these can work only for static systems. It highlights the need of 
another type of neural networks, called recurrent neural networks 
(RNNs), which have the ability to handle dynamic systems and, 
hence, RNNs perform more complicated computations for the com- 
plex systems [61,62] . A neural network which has one or more 
feedback loops, for reusing the output values of the network, in- 
cluding a global feedback loop throughout the network, and local 
feedback in a single neuron, is a called as RNN [63] . These neural 
networks have extensive number of applications in adaptive con- 
trol, optimization, signal processing, and pattern recognition (see 
[59,64] ). Most of these applications assume that global asymptotic 
or exponential stability is guaranteed for the recurrent neural net- 
works, which, in reality, is not always true, as the concealed neural 
network can be rendered unstable by RNN [59] . In addition, when 
these networks are implemented via a digital hardware, the per- 
formance degradation and instability can occur owing to the nite 
word-length restriction. The general equation for continuous-time 
recurrent neural network is as follows: 

¨B x

Neural networks are nonlinear; consequently, the previously devel- 
oped stability criteria [20¨C30,32¨C36] fail for the stability analysis 
of neural networks under overow condition. The model (43) be- 
comes same as (1) and (2) by incorporating the overow non- 
linearity and external perturbations with Lipschitz constant L 
 (under L f

Consequently, in this section we have shown that the proposed 
methodology can be successfully employed to evaluate the stability 
of the nonlinear systems, like recurrent neural networks (RNN) and 
state lters. Stability analysis of such systems cannot be performed 
by using previously reported criteria [20¨C30,32¨C36] under overow 
constraint caused by digital hardware limitations.

6. Conclusions 

This paper established two criteria for assessment of the sta- 
bility of digital nonlinear systems under the consequence of sat- 
uration overow nonlinearity (which is the direct result of nite 
word-length), without and with consideration of the disturbance 
from environment (which is also inevitable in a digital hardware). 
The proposed approaches investigated the asymptotic stability and 
uniformly ultimately bounded stability in the absence and pres- 
ence of external perturbations, respectively, for the nonlinear dig- 
ital lter. Appropriate Lyapunov function along with sector condi- 
tions were employed while considering the fact that most of the 
nonlinear systems are either globally or locally Lipschitz. The out- 
comes of both of the criteria were presented in form of LMIs for 
an ecient stability test. The proposed approaches can handle in- 
herent nonlinearity in the dynamics of a system as well as the sat- 
uration nonlinearity due to the digital hardware constraint for the 
stability analysis in contrast to the conventional methods. The re- 
sultant schemes were tested for two real-world physical systems, 
including an observer of a Moon chaotic system and a recurrent 
neural network. The state trajectories have been plotted and phase 
portraits are shown to converge to a bounded ellipsoidal region,

ensuring the uniformly ultimately bounded stability under external 
interferences. The simulation results demonstrated the usefulness 
of the developed approaches, and the importance of these criteria 
was further enhanced as the previous research works lack in of- 
fering the analysis of nonlinear digital systems¡¯ stability under the 
overow nonlinearity.
