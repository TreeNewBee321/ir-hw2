abstract

Polyaspartic acid (PASP) and its derivative (PASP-SEA-ASP) were tested as environmentally benign scale inhibi-
tors at lab scale for a polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membrane in the desalination of a synthetic brackish water
containing various scale-forming ions. Their performance was compared with a commercially available RO
antiscalant which contains phosphonic acid. The addition of the scaling inhibitors to feedwater led to increase
in water recovery and removal efciency of inorganic matter for the RO unit operated under constant transmem-
brane pressure, with PASP-SEA-ASP giving greater water recovery (90%) than PASP (87%) and the commercial
antiscalant (85%). PASP-SEA-ASP was superior to PASP and the commercial antiscalant in scaling inhibitor/foul-
ing reduction due to the reduced deposition of the scale forming ions on the membrane. Examination of the used
membranes with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction suggested the different effect of the
antiscalants was related to the resultant crystalline morphology on the membrane surface. The PASP and its de-
rivative appeared to be more cost effective in maintaining permeate ux and inhibiting the formation of a dense
scale layer. The present study demonstrated the great potential of these non-phosphorus containing agents for
scale inhibition in domestic and industrial wastewater reclamation and brackish water desalination applications.

1. Introduction

Membrane fouling caused by inorganic, organic and biological mate-
rials is a major problem limiting the efciency of reverse osmosis (RO)
based wastewater reclamation and brackish water desalination pro-
cesses. Inorganic fouling, known as scaling, occurs after deposition of in-
organic constituents on the RO membranes. The most common scale-
forming constituents in membrane processes are CaSO4, CaCO3, BaSO4,
calcium phosphates, silica, aluminum and ferric hydroxides [1,2]. Scal-
ing can reduce permeate ow due to formation of a cake layer by surface
blockage and/or bulk crystallisation with the inorganic deposits [3],
leading to signicantly increased operational cost for the membrane
systems. Scaling may also physically damage the membranes because
of ineffective scale removal and occurrence of irreversible pore plugging
during ltration. As such, scaling mitigation is a critical measure to en-
sure efcient RO operation for wastewater reclamation and brackish
water desalination.
Several methods can be used to prevent the scaling of RO mem-
branes, including (i) acidication of feedwater to reduce bicarbonate
by converting it into carbon dioxide, (ii) scale inhibitor chemicals
which change the physical and chemical nature of the depositor ions
and hence the scale growth mechanisms, (iii) operating conditions of
RO systems, and (iv) softening with lime or soda ash which react with
bicarbonate in the feed to produce CaCO3 sludge [4,5]. Antiscalants are
used widely in RO processes due to their high effectiveness for
preventing scaling. Antiscalants generally delay scale formation and
allow higher water recovery by hindering scale growth under supersat-
urated conditions [6]. Reitz [7] investigated a number of commercial
antiscalants for the control of scaling caused by SrSO4, CaSO4 and
CaCO3 in RO systems and found that they were effective for inhibiting
CaCO3 precipitation. Another study by Lisitsin et al. [8] reported that
zinc ion was promising to mitigate scaling for membrane processes.
However, many commercial antiscalants can enhance biofouling of RO
systems as they contain nutrients such as phosphorus [9,10,11]. More-
over, phosphorus-containing antiscalants remaining in the RO concen-
trate/brine can contribute to eutrophication of the receiving water
bodies and consequent blooms of harmful algae. It has been suggested
that most of the commercially available antiscalants are expensive,
and could account for approximately 10% of the total treatment cost
for the production of clean water [12]. As such, the development of
low-environmental risk and cost-effective antiscalants is required for
improving the sustainability of RO-based water purication processes.
Polyaspartic acid (PASP) is a polyamino acid which does not contain
phosphorus and is biodegradable. It was reported as being an environ-
mentally friendly antiscalant in the freshwater environment [13]. The
functional groups of PASP have a scale inhibition effect as they have a
side chain generated through the aminolysis reaction with amine-
group [14]. Gao et al. [15,16] synthesised a PASP derivative (PASP-
ASP) with the aim of enhancing the chelating performance of PASP
through the introduction of carboxylic acid to its side chain, and the ex-
perimental study demonstrated the improved scale inhibition effect of
the derivative in freshwater applications. It was suggested that PASP
could ionise and form molecular chains of negative charge, leading to
the formation of water-soluble complexes with Ca2+ and hence re-
duced deposition of the scale causing ions on membrane surface [13].
They also synthesised a PASP derivative (PASP-SEA-ASP) for enhancing
both chelation and dispersion performance by introducing sulfonic acid
and carboxylic acid to the side chain of PASP, with a view to inhibiting
scale formation in a saline water environment such as seawater [17].
As there is a sulfonic acid group in the molecular structure of PASP-
SEA-ASP, and when PASP-SEA-ASP is adsorbed onto the small crystal
particles, a double layer can be formed and the charge state of the par-
ticle surface is changed. This can result in enhanced dispersion of the
crystal particles in water. Although PASP and its derivative exhibited a
promising antiscaling effect on carbon steel in freshwater and seawater
for potential industrial applications such as scale inhibition for heat ex-
changers and water pipes, their effect on scale inhibition for polymeric
RO membranes used for wastewater and brackish water desalination
has not been investigated.
The present study was aimed at examining the antiscaling effect of
PASP and its derivative PASP-SEA-ASP on polyamide RO membranes
used for the desalination of a synthetic saline water containing various
scale-forming ions, and to compare them with a phosphorus-containing
commercial RO antiscalant. The antiscaling effect was assessed by deter-
mining the ltration performance in terms of water recovery within the
test period and removal efciency of inorganic matter, the quantity and
chemical composition of the scale on the membranes, and examining
the scale crystals formed on the membrane surface using scanning elec-
tron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. RO feedwater

The chemical composition of the synthetic feedwater used for the RO
tests is shown in Table 1. The chemicals were selected based on their
wide occurrence in the scale on RO membranes. The chemical reagents
used for the preparation of the RO feedwater were of analytical grade,
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2. Antiscalants

A commercial RO antiscalant that is widely used for wastewater de-
salination in many countries including Australia was tested in this
study. According to the manufacturer, the antiscalant is based on

phosphonic acid and polycarboxylic acid. The PASP and PASP-SEA-ASP
were synthesised in our lab with the methods described in Section 2.3.
The purity of PASP and PASP-SEA-ASP was determined as 99% and
98.5%, respectively. The antiscalant dosage of 1 mg/L (1 ppm) was
used for all RO antiscaling experiments.

2.3. Synthesis of antiscalants

2.3.1. PASP
PASP was synthesised through two steps. The rst step was the syn-
thesis of polysuccinimide, which was carried out in an electric thermo-
static drying oven through pyro-condensation of L-aspartic acid
(Industrial grade, Sigma Aldrich) monomer at 240 °„C for 4 h. The second
step was the synthesis of PASP. Firstly, polysuccinimide was suspended
in three times its weight of water. The aqueous polysuccinimide suspen-
sion was stirred at 12 °„C, and then NaOH solution (15%, industrial grade)
was added. The reaction was for 4 h at 12 °„C and pH 8®C9. Solid PASP was
obtained through the separation process involving the addition of dou-
ble volume of absolute alcohol, washing of the resultant precipitates
with deionised water, and then drying at 80 °„C for 48 h. PASP stock so-
lution (36%) was prepared by dissolving the solid PASP in deionised
water. The relevant synthetic reactions are expressed in Schemes 1
and 2.

2.3.2. PASP-SEA-ASP
Synthesis of PASP-SEA-ASP was through two steps. In the rst step,
polysuccinimide was synthesised as described in Section 2.3.1. The sec-
ond step was the synthesis of PASP-SEA-ASP, in which polysuccinimide
was rst suspended in three times its weight of water. The polysuccin-
imide suspension was stirred at 25 °„C, and then aspartic acid and 2-
aminoethanesulfonic (Industrial grade, Sigma Aldrich) which were dis-
solved in NaOH solutions (15%) were added. The reaction was for 24 h at
25 °„C and pH 8®C9. The pH of the mixture was then dropped to 5.2 by
adding 2 N HCl to remove the unreacted 2-aminoethane sulfonic acid
through ltration. Unreacted aspartic acid was removed from the solu-
tion by further dropping the pH to 2.8 and then ltration. Solid PASP-
SEA-ASP was obtained through a separation process in which a double
volume of absolute alcohol was added to the ltrate and the resultant
precipitate was rinsed using deionised water and dried at 80 °„C for
48 h. The stock solution of PASP-SEA-ASP (30%) was made through dis-
solving the obtained solid in deionised water. The relevant synthetic re-
action is expressed in Scheme 3.

2.4. RO tests

RO tests were performed using a at-sheet membrane (Polyamide
RO AG membrane, GE Osmonics) with a bench-scale cross ow RO rig
(SEPA CF, GE Osmonics). Before the ltration tests, RO membranes

were soaked in Milli-Q water at 4 °„C overnight after which deionised
water was passed through the membranes for removing chemical pre-
servatives and membrane compaction. During RO operation, a constant
transmembrane pressure of 10 bar and cross-ow rate of 0.1 m/s was
maintained. A refrigerated circulating bath (Neslab RTE 7, USA) was
used to maintain the temperature of the feedwater at 22 °¿ 2 °„C. Each
test was performed in duplicate and the average values of the results
were reported, a new membrane was used for each run. RO concentrate
and permeate samples were collected for analyses of water quality and
determining the water recovery over the testing period. The schematic
diagram of the RO testing system is presented in Fig. 1.
The following equation was used to calculate the water recovery:

WR  V p
V f

 100%

where WR is water recovery (%); Vf is the total volume of feedwater (L);
Vp is the total volume of permeate (L).

2.5. Analytical methods

The substances forming the scale on the RO membranes were ex-
tracted with acid solution (0.1 N H2SO4). The fouled membrane was
soaked in 2 L of acid solution at room temperature for 24 h and then
manually agitated using forceps for 5 min to extract the scale. The con-
centration of the metal ions of interest was determined by atomic ab-
sorption spectroscopy (AA-6501F, Shimadzu, Japan). Prior to the
analysis, all samples were pre-ltered using 0.45 ¶Ãm membrane lters
and then acidied using 40% nitric acid to stabilise the metal content.
Stock solution for each metal species was prepared for obtaining a stan-
dard curve to determine the concentration of the metal ion.
The dry weight of the unused and used membrane was measured to
calculate the amount of scale attached to the membrane for each
antiscalant. The membrane was dried for 12 h in a desiccator at room
temperature, and then weighed with an electronic balance (PA 114C,
Ohaus, China).
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI Quanta 200, Nova) was
employed to examine the scaling layer on the membrane surface. The
used membranes were dried at room temperature overnight prior to
the SEM examination. A small piece of the membrane was cut out and
coated with gold, and then held within the SEM chamber with

conductive and double-sided carbon tape. The accelerating voltage of
30 kV was maintained and images were acquired at 4000 °¡
magnication.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was undertaken for virgin and used
membranes using a Bruker AXS D4 Endeavor X-ray diffractometer
equipped with Lynxeye linear strip detector and copper anode. The
analysis was conducted using Cu-K¶¡ radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA
beam intensity. The data was collected between 5°„ and 55°„ 2-theta
ranges with a step size of 0.02°„ 2-theta and the counting time per step
was 1 s. Prior to the analysis, the used membranes were dried overnight
at room temperature.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Impact of scale inhibitors on RO permeate water quality

The concentration of the metal ions in feedwater, permeate and con-
centrate was examined to indicate the scale formation conditions. The
removal efciency of the ions by the membrane was increased by
adding antiscalant to the feedwater, with PASP-SEA-ASP giving greater
ion removals than PASP which in turn performed better than the com-
mercial antiscalant (Table 2). The greater concentration of the metal
ions in the concentrate stream for the PASP-SEA-ASP and PASP also sug-
gested less salt attachment to the membrane surface compared with the
commercial antiscalant. Analyses and quantication of the deposits ex-
tracted from the membrane surface conrmed that the antiscalants led
to reduced scale formation, with antiscaling effect in the order of PASP-
SEA-ASP N PASP N commercial antiscalant (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
In a previous study of the antiscaling effect of PASP-ABSA copoly-
mers [18], it was suggested that the reduced calcium scale formation
was due to the chelation of calcium ions and the subsequent formation
of stabilised and soluble chelates, which was attributed to the presence
of sulfonic groups and carboxylic ion in the scale inhibitors. In the pres-
ent study, it was likely that the antiscalants led to the formation of che-
lated structures with metal ions [19,20], resulting in less passage of salt
through the RO membrane and hence lower ion concentration in the
permeate. The higher ion concentration in the RO concentrate stream
would be a result of good solubility of the chelates [18]. However,
antiscalants cannot innitely increase the solubility of inorganic com-
pounds, after the solubility reaches a certain value, carbonate scale
will be produced. Since PASP-SEA-ASP possesses both carboxylic acid
groups and sulfonic acid groups, whereas PASP has only carboxylic
acid groups, greater inhibition of the deposition of the scale forming
ions on the membrane was expected for PASP-SEA-ASP compared
with PASP. Further work to examine the function of chelation of the
antiscalants and examine the solubility of calcium carbonate as a func-
tion of the antiscalants may be required to conrm the suggested
mechanism.
The water recovery was determined as 83% for the RO test without
using antiscalant, 85% for the commercial antiscalant, 87% for PASP

and 90% for PASP-SEA-ASP. These results were consistent with the ex-
pectation that the antiscalant exhibiting greater scale inhibiting effect
would result in less membrane inorganic fouling and hence higher
water productivity.

3.2. Characterisation of the scale formed on membrane surface

3.2.1. SEM images of scale crystals
SEM analysis of the used and unused membranes was carried out to
examine the scaling of the RO membranes in the presence of the various
antiscalants (Fig. 3). SEM image of the virgin membrane was also ob-
tained for comparison (Fig. 3a). In general, scale formation occurs via
several stages including ion pairing, formation of micro-aggregates,
micro-crystals and then macro-crystals, and eventually formation of
scale [21]. When no antiscalant was added to the feedwater, the scale
deposits on the RO membrane appeared to be present over the entire
membrane area sampled and formed a dense scale layer, mainly
consisted of distorted calcite crystals which appeared to have rough
rounded edges. Changes in crystal morphology were shown, which
was most likely due to antiscalant addition to the feedwater. The crys-
tals resulting from the antiscalants were signicantly larger in size
(Fig. 3c, d, and e). This was most probably because the antiscalants in-
creased the solubility of the inorganic compounds and delayed the for-
mation of the deposits, and when the concentration of solute increased
to a certain value, deposit formation began [19,20]. The resultant

crystals were signicantly larger in size because the formation of the
carbonate scale was inuenced by other ions such as Mg2+, Na+, Si4+
and Ca2+. With advancing outgrowth of the crystals, adsorbed scale in-
hibitor molecules were eventually overgrown [22]. This was in line with
a previous study in which the crystals were larger in size due to the in-
uence of other ions on carbonate scale in a groundwater environment
[23]. The build-up of larger crystallites was the result of the formation of
loose and irregular crystallites. However, some researchers found that
scale inhibition was due to the formation of smaller and more dispersed
®C in the syn-
carbonate crystallites when there was only Ca2+ and HCO3
thetic feedwater [15,24,25].
PASP and PASP-SEA-ASP appeared to lead to the formation of the
crystals with irregular shapes and loose structures. For PASP, the crys-
tals lost the sharp edges, and their morphology was changed from
smaller fragments to extended stick forms. The resultant crystals from
the addition of PASP-SEA-ASP were markedly larger in size and were
spindle shaped. A similar observation was made by Weijnen and
Rosmalen [22] who suggested that the larger and spindle shaped crys-
tals were the result of the increased adsorption of the polyelectrolyte in-
hibitor (based on either polyacrylic acid or polymaleic acid) onto the
gypsum crystal surface. The addition of the PASP-SEA-ASP to the
feedwater could affect the scaling process through (i) threshold inhibi-
tion, as lattice formation of regular crystals was inhibited via adsorption
on the active growth sites of crystals; (ii) crystal dispersion, whereby
micro-crystal growth and agglomeration was prevented via the in-
creased anionic charge of the membrane surface [26]; and (iii) crystal
modication, whereby the build-up of a regular crystalline lattice was
prevented via modication of the micro-crystal morphology/shape [21].
Overall, PASP-SEA-ASP led to the formation of larger sized crystals,
which were more sparsely distributed on the membrane surface com-
pared with PASP and the commercial antiscalant. This could result in a
partial coverage of the membrane by the loose structures, leading to sig-
nicantly improved mass transfer, which was consistent with the water
recovery results (Section 3.1). A similar observation was made by
Rahardianto et al. [27] who noted that the fractional ux reduction
was marked compared with the fractional surface area covered with
scale.

3.2.2. XRD analysis
The XRD spectra of the RO membranes were to help identify the var-
ious compounds such as calcite, aragonite, and vaterite that are respon-
sible for membrane scaling. The XRD results showed the presence of
vaterite at 32°„ 2-theta and 76°„ 2-theta, calcite at 46°„ 2-theta and 57°„
2-theta, and aragonite at 66°„ 2-theta, and 85°„ 2-theta (Table 3, and

Tang et al. [28] who found that different forms of compounds such as

respectively. These results indicated that the scale formed had a signif-
icantly different crystal composition. The addition of antiscalant appar-
ently led to the changes in the morphology of the crystal precipitates,
resulting in displacement and enhancement of the diffraction peaks.
At the same degree, the peaks exhibited different intensities for the
different antiscalants. The vaterite peak at 32°„ 2-theta was the highest
peak for all samples, indicating vaterite was a major component in the
scale crystals on the membranes. There was a higher peak intensity at
32°„ 2-theta for PASP than PASP-SEA-ASP. However, overall, the diffrac-
tion peaks for PASP-SEA-ASP were stronger than for the commercial
antiscalant or PASP (Table 3), indicating that the morphological changes
for the crystals resulted from the presence of PASP-SEA-ASP in the RO
feedwater. It should be noted the intensity of the diffraction peaks for
PASP-SEA-ASP is related not only to the composition, but also to the
crystallinity and the size of scale crystals [29]. PASP had stronger

229

peaks than the commercial antiscalant. These changes in the peaks illus-
trated that the crystal structure was signicantly different with the ad-
dition of various scale inhibitors. These changes likely resulted in the
loose structure of the crystals, and hence a less dense scale layer.

4. Conclusions

PASP and its derivative PASP-SEA-ASP were tested as potential envi-
ronmentally friendly antiscalants for mitigating scaling of a RO mem-
brane in the ltration of a synthetic saline feedwater containing
various scale forming ions, and compared with a commercially available
antiscalant. All scale inhibitors were capable of improving RO perfor-
mance in terms of water recovery and rejection of inorganic matter,
with PASP-SEA-ASP performing better compared with PASP which in
turn was better than the commercial antiscalant. SEM analysis con-
rmed the formation of larger crystals and less dense scale layer on
the membrane surface for the feedwater with added PASP-SEA-ASP
compared with the other antiscalants, which suggested the effective
chelation of scale-forming ions.
Overall, this study exhibited the potential of polyaspartic acid and its
derivative as scale inhibitors for their applications in wastewater and
brackish water desalination. As the cost of chemical per unit of water
treated was
$4.5 °¡ 10 6/m3
for
commercial
antiscalant,
$2.1 °¡ 10 6/m3 for PASP-SEA-ASP and $1.5 °¡ 10 6/m for PASP, PASP
and its derivate appeared to possess an advantage on cost-effectiveness.
It is recommended that further investigations into the impact of process
variables such as pH, inorganic species, the presence of organic matter
in feedwater, and membrane materials on their scale inhibition effect
be conducted at lab and pilot scales before being employed for full
scale applications.
