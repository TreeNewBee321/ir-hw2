abstract

The recently proposed minimum dispersion distortionless response (MDDR) beamformer is able to im- 
prove the reception of non-Gaussian signals over the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) 
beamformer. However, the performance of the MDDR beamformer degrades in the presence of fast- 
moving interferences. To suppress such an interference, a robust beamformer against fast-moving inter- 
ferences based on the minimum dispersion (MD) criterion is proposed, which provides a continuous deep 
null sector over a predened range of dynamic angle-of-arrival (AOA). The designed beamformer ensures 
that the output is minimized in terms of dispersion and the average power over the dynamic AOA is zero 
via a quadratic constraint. In order to reduce the computational load, the optimization problem with a 
quadratic constraint is relaxed to its counterpart with a linear constraint. This allows us to devise an 
ecient beamforming approach, namely, gradient projection algorithm. Numerical results are provided 
to demonstrate that the developed beamformer can suppress the strong fast-moving interferences effec- 
tively.

1. Introduction 

Beamforming is a spatial lter used to enhance the signal-of- 
interest (SOI) and mitigate the interference as well as noise. It has 
been widely used in radar, sonar, communications, biomedical and 
audio signal processing [1¨C4] . 
Compared with conventional delay-and-sum beamforming, 
adaptive beamforming approaches are able to more eciently en- 
hance the SOI and suppress interference and noise [1] . However, 
the performances of most adaptive beamforming techniques de- 
teriorate under challenging environments such as angle-of-arrival 
(AOA) mismatch, imperfect array calibration, and sensor location 
error. In order to tackle this issue of robust beamforming in some 
challenging scenarios, various adaptive beamforming algorithms 
under the minimum variance (MV) criterion have been suggested 
[1,5¨C12] . In this work, we consider two commonly encountered 
situations where the performances of adaptive beamforming algo- 
rithms degrade. 
In the rst case, a fast-moving interference crosses the obser- 
vation region of a receiving array, in which the AOA of the in- 
terference is not xed but varies with time. Such an interference 
will inuence the SOI reception and results in reduction of output 
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Usually, a null is de- 
signed to cancel the interference by making the response to the 
interference with zero [13] . With multiple interferences, multiple 
similar constraints are imposed, which lead to the linearly con- 
strained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer [4] . However, in 
this case, the degree-of-freedom of the LCMV beamformer is af- 
fected to the number of linear constraints. The LCMV beamformer 
does not perform well with an interference whose AOA varies 
quickly with time. Unlike the LCMV approach, the null-broadening 
technique provides a null sector to suppress a fast-moving inter- 
ference. In [14] , the interferers were made to cover a greater an- 
gular extent by applying a transformation to the sample covari- 
ance matrix (SCM). As the transformation in [14] would introduce 
the noise contribution to the SCM, the method of dispersion syn- 
thesis was proposed in [15] to avoid additional noise power in- 
volved in the SCM. In [15] , adaptive trough patterns were pro- 
duced by distributing a cluster of virtual equal-strength incoher- 
ent interferences around each original source. The null-broadening 
method of derivative constraint was proposed in [16,17] , but has a 
much greater computational load than those of [14,15] . The min- 
imum power distortionless response (MPDR) beamformer, which 
constrained the output power in a predened angular sector be- 
low a pre-specied suppression level by using a quadratic con- 
straint, was proposed in [18] . To reduce computational complexity, 
the original quadratic constraint in [18] was replaced with a set of 
linear constraints in [19] to produce a widened null sector over the 
fast-moving interference. 
In the second case, the signals and interferences encountered 
in practice are often non-Gaussian distributed. Zero-mean ran- 
dom signals can be classied as super-Gaussian, Gaussian and sub- 
Gaussian, according to the kurtosis measure which describes the 
tail shapes of their distributions [20] . Most of the encountered sig- 
nals in practice are non-Gaussian distributed, e.g., speech, acous- 
tic signals, and modulated signals in radar, sonar, GPS navigation 
and wireless communications [21] . The beamformers based on the 
MV criterion are optimal for Gaussian signals, because they make 
full use of the second-order statistical information of Gaussian sig- 
nals. For non-Gaussian situations, however, the MV beamformer 
suffers performance degradation as the higher-order and lower- 
order statistical information has been ignored. The non-Gaussianity 
of signals applied to blind beamforming and impulsive noise sup- 
pression were considered in [22,23] . The minimum dispersion dis- 
tortionless response (MDDR) beamformer for non-Gaussian sig- 
nals, which minimizes the 
 p -norm of the output while constrain- 
ing the response of SOI to unity, was proposed in [24¨C27] . The 
MDDR beamformer exhibits better performance of non-Gaussian 
signals reception than the minimum variance distortionless re- 
sponse (MVDR) beamformer. 
Although the MDDR beamformer exhibits superior performance 
for non-Gaussian signal reception, its performance deteriorates in 
the presence of fast-moving interferences. To tackle this issue, we 
devise a new beamforming approach based on the minimum dis- 
persion (MD) criterion [24] , which is able to eliminate the power of 
the interference from the beamformer output by constraining the 
average power of the interference¡¯s dynamic angular sector to zero. 
This provides a broad deep null sector, which in turn enables us 
to handle the fast-moving interferences. The proposed beamformer 
has two advantages: First, it shares the same performance with 
the MDDR beamformer for sub-Gaussian signal reception; Second, 
it is much more robust against fast-moving interferences than the 
MVDR and MDDR beamformers. 
Moreover, the optimization problem in the proposed beam- 
former consists of a convex objective function and a linear con- 
straint. This problem can be solved using the software of interior- 
point method (IPM) via CVX and SeDuMi [28] . In order to reduce 
the computational load, the gradient projection (GP) algorithm is 
applied to solve the optimization problem. Besides, the computa- 
tional complexity of the algorithm is also analysed. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the sig- 
nal model for array processing along with a brief introduction to 
the MPDR and standard MDDR beamformers. In Section 3 , the lin- 
early constrained MDDR beamforming approach is formulated in 
the case of fast-moving interferences. To solve the linearly con- 
strained optimization problem for MDDR beamformer, the GP algo- 
rithm is revisited. Computer simulations are performed to evaluate 
the performance of the proposed beamformer in Section 4 . Finally, 
conclusions are drawn in Section 5 .

2.2. MPDR Beamformer 

Consider the commonly encountered scenario in practice that 
a fast-moving interference crosses the observation region, where 
the AOA of the interference varies with time. In this situation, an 
interference can be anywhere in [ 
, 
¦È max ], which poses a big 
challenge for accurate reception of the SOI and effective suppres- 
sion of interference. The MPDR beamformer [19] , which designs a 
¦È max ] with a pre-specied suppres- 
broad null sector over [ 
, 
sion level, is reformulated in this work to handle the issue of ro- 
bust beamforming against fast-moving interferences. It can be ex- 
pressed as the following constrained optimization problem:

Here, s ( n ) belongs to the class of sub-Gaussian signals if

s ( n ) is a super-Gaussian signal if 
 3; and the kurtosis of a 
Gaussian signal is equal to 3. Super-Gaussian signals are very com- 
mon in practice, such as speech, biomedical signals and impulsive 
noise [20,29,30] . Sub-Gaussian signals are widely used in sonar, 
radar and GPS navigation, such as quadrature phase-shift keying

munication signals [20,21] . 
The MDDR beamformer is proposed for non-Gaussian signals by 
 (cid:10)(cid:10)w 
exploiting the 
 p -norm of the data received by the array. Speci- 
cally, the corresponding optimization problem is formulated as

in statistics, which is also the generalization of variance for non- 
Gaussian signals, the MVDR beamformer is a special case of the

3. Linearly constrained minimum dispersion beamforming 
against fast-moving interference 

3.1. Robust MDDR beamformer against fast-moving interference 

The standard MDDR beamformer exhibits excellent perfor- 
mance for non-Gaussian signal reception. However, it deteriorates 
in the presence of a fast-moving interference. To suppress such an 
interference, a robust beamformer based on the MD criterion is 
proposed in this section, which provides a continuous deep null 
sector over a predened range of dynamic AOA. 

3.1.1. Linearly constrained MDDR beamformer 
As the fast-moving interferences usually exhibit the property of 
sub-Gaussian distribution [20,21] , this paper just focuses on the 
sub-Gaussian scenarios. Therefore, unless stated otherwise the sig- 
nals and interferences are assumed to be sub-Gaussian and p 
is adopted, while the additive noise is Gaussian distributed. 
Due to nite samples, replacing the expectation with the sam- 
ple mean and discarding the constant 1/ N , (7) is rewritten as

Motivated by the MPDR beamformer described in Section 2.2 , 
the fast-moving interference can be suppressed by eliminating 
the average power over the sector [

MDDR beamformer output. Therefore, the MDDR beamformer with

To achieve a deeper null sector against strong fast-moving inter- 
ferences, the value of 
¦Ç is preferred to be zero, which leads to the 
quadratic constraint denoted in (9) that is equivalent to a linear 
constraint w 
 i.e., the weight vector w lies in the null- 
space N ( Q sub 
). Furthermore, the two linear constraints are com- 
bined as

The optimization problem shown in (12) with a linear con- 
straint can be solved more eciently than the one in (9) . More- 
over, the null depth achieved by (12) is deeper than that achieved 
by (9) , as the quadratic constraint is set to zero. 

3.1.2. Choice of p 
The MDDR beamformer implicitly exploits the non-Gaussianity 
of signals, which signicantly improves the performance of non- 
Gaussian signal reception. However, there is no explicit formula to 
describe the relationship between p and 
¦Ê s [24¨C26] . The general 
guideline is that p is determined by the non-Gaussianity of signals 
indicated by 
¦Ê s , that is, p 
 2 for sub-Gaussian signals and p 
2 for super-Gaussian signals. Particularly, for sub-Gaussian signals 
the larger value of p leads to better performance in terms of output 
SINR. The near-optimal performance is achieved when p 
 [25] . 
However, too large value of p is easy to result in overow when 
calculating the p th power of a number in engineering application. 
Fortunately, for sub-Gaussian signals, such as PSK and QAM, the 
performance of MDDR beamformer is satised when the value of 
p is around 20 [26] .

3.2. GP Algorithm 

For the optimization problem in (12) , the objective function and 
constraint are both convex, while the variable is a complex vector. 
Conventional methods for solving the convex optimization prob- 
lem can be modied to solve this problem. In the following sub- 
sections, an ecient algorithm is developed for solving this mini- 
mization problem following the framework of GP algorithm. 

3.2.1. Projection onto the feasible region 
The feasible region of (12) is denoted as

any vector s not belonging to 
 the projection of s onto 
(¡¤)

 which is the point located at

4. Numerical results 

In this section, four numerical experiments are conducted 
to demonstrate the performance of the optimal weight vectors 
achieved by the developed algorithm. As QPSK signals are typical 
sub-Gaussian signals which have been widely used in various ar- 
eas, such as TV, WiFi and wireless communications. According to 
the denition of kurtosis in (6) , it is easy to attain 
QPSK 
 1 . In 
the following simulations, we assume that the signals of the SOI 
and interferences are QPSK modulated, while the noise is additive 
white Gaussian noise (AWGN). A ULA of 20 sensors with a half 
wavelength spacing is utilized. Suppose that there are four uncor- 
related QPSK signal sources, distributed in the far-eld of the array. 
The AOA of SOI is 
 43 
 and the AOAs of three interferences 
60 
are 
 30 
60 
 75 
 and 
. The interference from the 
direction of 
is the fast-moving interference, whose width of 
65 
55 
dynamic AOA is 
 10 
from 
to 
. Whereas the other 
two interferences are xed at the AOAs of 30 ¡ã and 75 ¡ã. The signal- 
to-noise ratio (SNR) is dened as

4.1. Experiment 1 

In this subsection, the beampatterns for various p of the pro- 
posed approach is evaluated when SNR 
 0 dB and the number 
of snapshots is 400. Although the MDDR beamformer is prefer 
to adopt p 
 2 for sub-Gaussian signals, the scenarios of p 
and p 
 5 are also involved to explore the performances of the 
standard MDDR and the proposed beamformer with different p . 
In comparison with the proposed beamformer, the beampatterns 
generated by the standard MDDR beamformer in the presence of 
fast-moving interference is shown in Fig. 2 , while the simulation 
results of GP algorithm under the same simulation conditions are 
depicted in Fig. 3 , in which the red dash lines indicate the pre- 
specied null sector and the AOA of SOI. From Figs. 2 and 3 , it 
can be seen that the GP algorithm is able to provide a deep null 
80 dB over the pre-specied sector of [ 
65 
55 
of more than 
] 
which can suppress the strong fast-moving interferences eciently. 
Moreover, the scenario of p 
 2 shown in Fig. 3 is the same as 
the one proposed in [19] . Compared with the simulation results 
in [19] , the null depth achieved by (12) is deeper, in which the 
constraint on the average power over the predened angular sector 
is set to zero. 
Furthermore, the null depths provided by the standard MDDR 
beamformer and GP algorithm at the AOAs of 30 ¡ã and 75 ¡ã are 
shown in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. It can be seen that the 
GP algorithm provides much deeper nulls for those xed inter- 
ferences over the standard MDDR beamformer. In Table 2 , deeper 
nulls can be achieved when the value of p is greater than 2. Recall 
that when p 
 the MDDR beamformer is reduced to the MPDR 
beamformer.

It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the performance of the proposed 
beamformer is affected by the value of p . Specically, the output 
SINR increases with the increase of p . When p 
 20 
 the output 
SINR of the proposed beamformer is close to the upper bound, 
which is the reason why the larger value of p is not adopted. Com- 
paring the experimental results of p 
 2 and p 
 20 
 it is indicated 
again that the MDDR beamformer exhibits better performance in 
sub-Gaussian signals reception than the MVDR beamformer.

4.3. Experiment 3 

The output SINR versus the number of snapshots with SNR 
10 dB is shown in Fig. 5 . It is seen that the output SINR increases 
as the number of snapshots increases. The GP algorithm is sen- 
¡Ü 8, while the near- 
sitive to the number of snapshots when p 
optimal output SINR is achieved when p 
 20 which just needs 
100 snapshots. 
The proposed GP algorithm is integrated with backtracking line 
search algorithm to determine the optimal step size 
shown in 
(18) . Exploring Algorithm 1 , the value of 
is affected by 
¦Ã and 
¦Ä , which makes the algorithm converge to different w opt and dif- 
ferent output SINRs. The proposed GP algorithm is sensitive to 
the settings of 
¦Ã and 
¦Ä when p adopts small values, specially 
p 
 1 . The results shown in Fig. 5 are attained when 
 6 and 
 05 .

5. Conclusion 

Most of signals encountered in real-world applications are non- 
Gaussian distributed. The MVDR beamformer and its variants, 
based on the minimum variance criterion, turn out to be sub- 
optimal for non-Gaussian signals as they just exploit the second- 
order statistical information of non-Gaussian signals. The MDDR 
approach was proposed to handle the non-Gaussianity of signals 
with the aim at improving the reception of non-Gaussian signals. 
This paper extends the MDDR beamformer to handle fast-moving 
interferences, in which a continuous deep null sector over a prede- 
ned range of dynamic AOA is desired. To make the MDDR beam- 
former robust against the fast-moving interference, the proposed 
beamformer minimizes the output based on the MD criterion and 
constrains the average power over the dynamic AOA to be zero via 
a quadratic constraint. In order to reduce the computational com- 
plexity, a linear rather than a quadratic constraint is derived. Fur- 
thermore, the GP algorithm is developed. Experimental results con- 
rm that the proposed beamforming approach is able to suppress 
the fast-moving interferences effectively.
