Negative Results in Computer Vision: A Perspective

Ali Borji


abstract

A negative result is when the outcome of
an experiment or a model is not what is expected or
when a hypothesis does not hold. Despite being often
overlooked in the scientic community, negative results
are results and they carry value. While this topic has
been extensively discussed in other elds such as social
sciences and biosciences, less attention has been paid
to it in the computer vision community. The unique
characteristics of computer vision, particularly its ex-
perimental aspect, call for a special treatment of this
matter. In this manuscript, I will address what makes
negative results important, how they should be dissemi-
nated and incentivized, and what lessons can be learned
from cognitive vision research in this regard. Further, I
will discuss matters such as experimental design, statis-
tical hypothesis testing, explanatory versus predictive
modeling, performance evaluation, model comparison,
reproducibility of ndings, the conuence of computer
vision and human vision, as well as computer vision
research culture.

1 Introduction

What is a negative result? One may characterize a neg-
ative result as §when a hypothesis does not hold§ or
§when the outcome of an experiment or a model is not
what is expected§. Such a denition, however, could
be one out of many possible denitions. One may ar-
gue that an unexpected result is actually a good use-
ful positive result to share. Another possible denition
is that a negative result is when the performance is

not better given metrics such as accuracy. Regardless of
how negative results are dened, such challenging and
sometimes inconclusive ndings are often discouraged
and buried in the drawers and computers. Therefore,
the publication record reects only a tiny slice of the
conducted research. In some sense they fabricate the
§dark matter§ of science. Such ndings, however, still
hold value. At the very least they can save resources
by preventing researchers from repeating the same ex-
periments. Perhaps the main reason for an overwhelm-
ingly high number of negative results not put forward
for dissemination is the lack of incentives. Interestingly,
some researchers have even argued that most published
ndings are false [1]. Some also claim that hiding neg-
ative results is unethical. Nevertheless, negative results
have been and continue to be constructive in the ad-
vancement of the science (e.g., Michelson-Morley ex-
periment [2]).

To answer whether negative results are important
in computer vision, should be published, or even if it
makes sense to talk about them, rst we need to investi-
gate how computer vision research is conducted relative
to scientic practices and methodologies conducted in
other elds such as social or biological sciences. Com-
puter vision research consists of a mixture of theoretical
and experimental research. A small fraction of publica-
tions introduce principled theories for vision tasks (e.g.,
optical ow [3]). A large number of publications report
models and algorithms (e.g., for solving the ob ject de-
tection problem) that are more powerful than contend-
ing models. Thus, compared to other elds, computer
vision is relatively less hypothesis-driven and more prac-
tical. Some negative results oer invaluable insights re-
garding strength and shortcomings of existing models
and theories, while others provide smart baselines. The
emphasis has traditionally been placed on improving

2

existing models in terms of performance over bench-
mark datasets. While some papers conduct statistical
tests, it is not the common practice. As in some other
elds, there is a high tendency among computer vision
researchers to submit positive results as such results are
often considered to be more novel by the reviewers.
Computer vision has its own unique characteristics
making it distinct from other elds, thereby demanding
a specic treatment of negative results. Firstly, vision
is an extremely hard problem which has baed many
smart people throughout the history. The complexity of
the problem makes it dicult to run controlled exper-
iments and come up with a universal theory of vision.
Secondly, often a lot of variables are involved in build-
ing vision algorithms and in analyzing large amounts
of data. Further, fair comparison of several competing
models using multiple evaluation scores exacerbates the
problem. To address these, it would be very helpful to
borrow from other elds (e.g., natural sciences) where
experimental design and statistical testing are integral
parts of the scientic research.
The common practice in experimental hypothesis-
driven elds (e.g., cognitive science) include carefully
formulating a hypothesis, identifying and controlling
confounding factors, designing the right stimulus set,
collecting high quality data, and performing appropri-
ate statistical tests. These are complicated to perform
in computer vision research as often many factors are
involved. In particular, statistical analysis becomes very
challenging in presence of many parameters and mod-
els. This makes it complicated to decide which statisti-
cal test is needed or when statistical analysis is critical
to conduct. Principled and systematic gauging of the
progress (rather than relying on trials and error and
luck) helps judge what truly works and what does not
and, hence steer the research in the right direction. For
instance, we might have not given up on neural net-
works easily if we did more careful rigorous analyses in
the past.
Notice that dealing with negative results is a very
controversial topic and still unsettled in many elds. So,
do not expect this writing to touch on all of the aspects.
Rather, here, I try to shed light on some less explored
matters and put computer vision in a broader perspec-
tive with respect to science in general, and its related
elds such as Neuroscience and Cognitive Science, in
particular. Indeed, further discussion is needed in the
vision community to converge to a consensus regarding
treatment of negative results.
In what follows, rst I elaborate on science versus
engineering and where computer vision ts. I will con-
tinue with a comparison of computer and human vision
research and how they relate to each other in terms of

goals, research methodologies and practices. This is fol-
lowed by discussions of negative results and statistical
analysis in the context of computer vision. Section 6
considers the dissemination of negative results. Finally,
a wrap up is presented in the epilogue.

2 Computer Vision: Engineering or Science?

Let＊s start with the question of whether computer vi-
sion is a scientic or an engineering discipline, or both.
Science is concerned with understanding fundamental
laws of nature, whereas engineering involves the ap-
plication of science to create technology, products and
services useful for society. Science asks questions about
nature while engineers design solutions to problems.

As a scientic discipline, computer vision is con-
cerned with gaining high-level understanding from dig-
ital images, video sequences, views from multiple cam-
eras, or multi-dimensional data. It seeks to automate
tasks that the human visual system can do and involves
the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis
to achieve automatic visual understanding. Further, it
deals with constructing a physical model of the scene
(i.e., how the scene is created), how light interacts with
the scene, as well as low-, intermediate-, and high-level
descriptions of the scene content [4]. In other words, the
ultimate goal of computer vision is image understand-
ing, the ability not only to recover image structure but
also to know what it represents. As a technological and
engineering discipline, computer vision seeks to apply
its theories and models for the construction of computer
vision systems and applications.

Science and engineering are complementary and are
beautifully and happily married in computer vision. We
have a very solid in-depth scientic understanding of
phenomena such as image formation, depth perception,
stereoscopic vision, color perception and optical ow.
Some engineering applications, among many, include
biometrics (robust face and ngerprint recognition), op-
tical character recognition, gesture recognition, motion
capture, game playing, structure from motion, image
stitching, machine inspection, retail, 3D model build-
ing, medical imaging, automotive safety, autonomous
cars, assistive systems, and surveillance (in trac and
security). In this respect, computer vision is both theo-
retical (e.g., optical ow formulation) and experimental
(e.g., model replication, parameters tuning, hacks, and
tricks).

3 Computer Vision and Biological Vision

Vision is a broad interdisciplinary area. Both computer
and human vision systems share the same ob jective
which is converting light into useful signals from which
accurate models of the physical world can be constructed.
This information helps an agent (e.g., be it a robot or
a human) live, act, and survive in its environment.
For a long time, human vision research has been con-
centrated on understanding the principles and mecha-
nisms by which biological visual systems (with higher
emphasis on primate vision) operate. This is in essence
a reverse engineering (or inverse graphics) task. Like-
wise, computer vision research seeks a theory and engi-
neering implementation. Despite sharing the same goal,
they own unique characteristics. Early human visual
sensory mechanisms, including the retina and the Lat-
eral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN), are much more elabo-
rate than current digital cameras (CCD sensors). Neu-
ral networks in higher visual areas (e.g., visual ventral
stream) accommodate a sophisticated hierarchical pro-
cessing through cascades of ltering (modeled as con-
volution), pooling, lateral inhibition, and normaliza-
tion mechanisms. The result is a selective and invari-
ant representation of the ob jects and scenes. This is
somewhat akin to what Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) [5] do. Almost half of the human brain (consid-
ered to the the most complex known physical systems
and thus a ma jor scientic challenge) is devoted directly
or indirectly to vision. The entire brain needs about 20
watts to operate (enough to run a dim light bulb). A
processor as smart as the brain requires at least 10 to
20 megawatts of electricity to operate [6]. As to pro-
cessing speed, the brain is still faster than the fastest
supercomputers [7]. A remarkable capability of human
vision is attention (a.k.a active vision) which allows se-
lecting the most relevant and informative part of the
massive incoming visual stimulus (at a rate of 10 8 -109
bits/sec) [8]. Both human and computer vision systems
have their own biases. Human vision is extremely sen-
sitive to faces and optical illusions. Similarly, computer
vision systems get easily fooled by adversarial exam-
ples [9]. One thing that we know, almost for sure, is
that vision should be solved by frameworks that start
with extracting simple features and build increasingly
more complex ones. This is mainly because the world
we live in is compositional.
There has indeed been a cross-pollination in the two
elds (e.g., [10每21]). On the one hand, experimental
paradigms and psychophysics tools in cognitive vision
have been exploited to study the behavior of computer
vision algorithms or to interpret how they work. For ex-
ample, Parikh and Zitnick [22] employed the image jum-

3

bling paradigm, introduced in [23], to inspect whether
some computer vision algorithms capture local or global
scene information. Deng et al. [24] used the bubbling
paradigm, proposed by Gosselin and Schyns [ 25], to
model ne grained ob ject recognition. The rapid (or
ultra rapid) serial visual presentation [26, 27], has been
utilized to investigate the quality of images generated
by Generative Adversarial Networks [28]. Vondrick et
al. [29] and Fong et al., [30] leveraged human recogni-
tion biases to improve machine classiers. On the other
hand, computational tools have been exploited heavily
to understand how human vision works. For example,
deep convolutional networks have recently been used
to study the representational space in the visual ven-
tral stream (e.g., [31]). Moreover, a plethora of com-
puter vision, image processing, and machine learning
tools have been utilized in biological vision research for
the purposes such as stimulus design, discovering cues
humans might rely on in solving a task, and modeling
single neurons and neural populations.

In terms of performance, while computer vision has
made large strides, it is still nowhere near human vi-
sion. In general, it seems that computer vision is better
than human vision in some restricted tasks where vari-
ability is relatively low (e.g., optical character recog-
nition, ngerprint recognition, frontal face recognition,
etc). However, it lags far behind in cases where variabil-
ity is high (e.g., view invariant ob ject recognition [ 32]).
Current state of the art computer vision techniques re-
volve around deep learning models [33], in particular
CNNs [5]. These models have outperformed traditional
techniques on a wide variety of vision problems. It is
even claimed that CNNs outperform humans on classic
hard problems such as scene recognition [34]. Never-
theless, while nature has evolved a very ecient robust
biological solution to the problem of vision, computer
vision is still looking for a general computational the-
ory, let alone ecient physical implementations (e.g.,
on Silicon).

While both research communities have accumulated
a great wealth of knowledge, they are struggling with
some common long-standing challenging problems. Per-
haps the biggest of all is the invariance problem which
is believed to be the holy grail of vision. Humans are
remarkably good at recognizing ob jects under drastic
variations (e.g., illumination, rotation, blur, and occlu-
sion) but the mechanisms behind this capacity in bio-
logical vision are still unknown. There has been a great
deal of research in computer vision to come up with
invariant representations. Although the current state
of art algorithms (i.e., CNNs) provide partial invari-
ance to some transformations (e.g., translation, rota-
tion, and scale), a principled theory is yet to be devel-

4

oped (See for instance [35]). This is where cross talks in
both elds can be extremely useful. Another challenge,
related to the rst one, is the role of feedback and top-
down modulation in visual processing. The resurgence
of deep neural networks has raised the hope that maybe
a universal solution to deal with all vision problems is
within our reach. This is even more conceivable when
we notice that a) CNNs are rooted in the seminal nd-
ings of Hubel and Wiesel [36], and b) biological vision
systems might be following similar mechanisms as in
CNNs (e.g., [21, 31, 37, 38]).

As for the research practice, dierent methodologies
have been adopted in the two elds, driven by dier-
ent (sometimes short term) goals and constraints (e.g.,
building a technology versus proving a hypothesis). Re-
search in computer vision is traditionally benchmark-
driven where algorithms that perform better than oth-
ers are favored. The emphasis is on improving accu-
racy. Meanwhile, human vision research is primarily
hypothesis-driven. Hypotheses, null and alternative, are
carefully formulated, confounding factors are controlled,
an appropriate stimulus set is created, behavioral or
physiological data is carefully collected, and appropri-
ate statistical tests are conducted. The outcome is valid
until proven otherwise. It is the collection of evidences,
for or against a hypothesis, that drives the science.
Here, I would like to bring an example from my own
work in eye movement research. A study by Greene and
Wolfe [39] reported a failure in predicting an observer＊s
task from his xations (essentially a negative result) ef-
fectively negating the anecdotal nding of Yarbus [ 40].
In a reinvestigation [32], we repeated the experiment
by considering a larger set of parameters over a bigger
dataset. To their contrary, we concluded that Yarbus＊
hypothesis still holds. Several follow-up studies also sup-
ported our nding thus reinforcing the original hypoth-
esis.

There is a discrepancy of opinions on the relation-
ship between computer and biological vision. Some re-
searchers argue that the human visual system provides
the most compelling reference model. We can learn much
from it as an existence proof and as a great source
of inspiration. Therefore, there should be a symbio-
sis between the two communities as they address the
same problem. Some others, to the contrary, argue that
since the two systems function under very dierent con-
straints, the articial vision solution does not necessar-
ily need to mimic the biological solution (in reference
to the ying). Nonetheless, it seems, to me, that the
time is ripe for both communities to learn from each
other to address challenging problems in vision. A great
wealth of biological data (behavioral and neurophysio-
logical) and computational models (e.g., dierent CNN

architectures) are available that should be linked for
understanding the visual system and building better
algorithms.

4 Negative Results in Computer Vision

§Those who cannot remember the past are condemned
to repeat it.§
- George Santayana
Let me rst dene some buzzwords before turning
the discussion to computer vision.
Publication bias: coined by Theodore Sterling in
1959 [41], points to the situation where §publication
of research results depends not just on the quality of
the research but also on the hypothesis tested, and the
signicance and direction of eects detected§ [ 42]. It
is sometimes referred to as the §le drawer eect,§ or
§le drawer problem§ [43]. As the name suggests, re-
sults not supporting the original hypotheses (i.e., nega-
tive results or Null hypotheses) often end up buried in
researchers＊ le drawers. It is also called the §Positive-
results bias§ where positive (or successful) results are
more likely to be submitted, or accepted than negative
or inconclusive results. Therefore, what is published is
not the true representative of all results. Perhaps the
main reason behind the tendency towards publishing
positive results is the intense competition among sci-
entists. The unwritten §publish or perish§ rule drives
academics to publish interesting high quality papers in
large volumes to get more citations and to secure funds
to do their research.
Conrmation bias (a.k.a conrmatory bias or my-
side bias): is a type of cognitive bias in which one tends
to favor, accept, interpret, or recall ndings that align
with his preexisting beliefs or hypotheses [ 44].
Negative results either go completely unpublished
or are somehow turned into positive results through
adjustments (e.g., selective reporting, post-hoc reinter-
pretation, methods alteration, dierent data analyses,
increasing the number of observations). A generic term
coined to describe these post-hoc choices is HARKing
(§Hypothesizing After the Results are Known§). I will
elaborate on this further in the next section.
There are arguments for and against publishing neg-
ative results. Let＊s look at some supporting arguments
rst. Such results should be part of the scientic record
for the sake of completeness. Without them, literature
surveys and meta-analyses would be biased. They can
save a lot of eorts by preventing researchers to con-
duct redundant investigations. Further, they motivate
critical evaluation, analytical thinking and discussions,
thus contributing to the intellectual sophistication of
the community. Some counter arguments include the

followings. Negative results should be less favored due
to the scarcity of space. This seems to be no longer an is-
sue in the age of digital publication. Some people argue
that negative results can lead to a phenomenon known
as the §cluttered oce phenomenon§ where in an oce
full of academic papers, it is hard to tell the good ones
from the poor ones [45]. This resonates with computer
vision research where the eld is already replete with an
overwhelmingly high volume of publications per year,
making separating the wheat from the cha daunting.

Notice that negative result is dierent than no re-
sult. No result is a situation where nothing is complete
or a work has been done incompletely or incorrectly
thus leading to inconclusive or unreliable ndings. Ex-
amples include a) not having enough participants to
do a meaningful analysis, b) not having a control con-
dition for an intervention, c) faulty measurements, or
d) inconclusive or wrong statistical analysis. Neverthe-
less, negative results carry value, although modest. In
theory, information from an experiment is not abso-
lutely zero, if done correctly. Even when an experiment
gives the exact same result as before (i.e., replication),
a higher condence towards that nding is gained. In
some sense, this resembles probability density estima-
tion but over dierent explanations for a phenomenon.
Not every negative result is interesting though. As an
example, consider training a CNN to do a certain task.
Often a lot of trickery is involved to properly train a
CNN. Now, should one write a paper on the basis that
choosing a certain parameter (e.g., training the network
for 10 epochs instead of 100) does not lead to a conver-
gence? At the end of the day, what matters is how much
a study adds to what is already known, regardless of the
sign of the outcome.

Negative results, with a slightly more liberal de-
nition, highlight limitations, failures, or aws of com-
puter vision models, datasets, or scores. For instance,
adversarial images demonstrate situations where CNNs
can be easily fooled [9] while humans have no trou-
ble recognizing them. In image captioning literature, it
has been shown that a nearest neighbor classier that
simply chooses the caption of the most similar image to
the test image, outperforms state of the art methods (in
2015 [46]). In saliency modeling [8], naive baselines such
as the average xation map or a central Gaussian blob
outperform several xation prediction models [ 47]. In
ob ject detection, some works have identied the cases
where histogram of oriented gradients [48] fails on cer-
tain detection problems [49]. Smart baselines (e.g., a
classier that picks the label of the most frequent class)
dene the lower bounds while human performance gives
an upper-bound on performance and helps identify the
weak links in models. Some of this type of papers tend

5

to have titles that start with §In defense of ﹞ ﹞ ﹞ §. An ex-
ample is the famous paper by Richard Hartley entitled
§In defense of the eight-point algorithm§ [50] where he
shows that applying a very simple normalization be-
fore computing the fundamental matrix from a set of
eight or more points results in a robust method that
is comparable with the best iterative algorithms. SLIC
superpixels [51] is another example where authors show
how standard k-means with spatially uniform seeds can
work very well. Thus, baseline methods are complemen-
tary to negative results and help gauge the progress and
move the eld forward. In addition to these, visualiza-
tion techniques have also proven to be very eective in
understanding, interpreting, and evaluating computer
vision models (e.g., [52, 53]).

A related problem here is the issue of replicability
or reproducibility. Replicability of ndings is believed
to be at the heart of empirical sciences [ 54]. As in other
elds, computer vision researchers tend not to replicate
other people＊s works for two ma jor reasons. Either it is
possible to replicate someone else＊s work or it is not. In
the former case, a reviewer may nd your results boring
or predictable. In the latter case, you may be accused
of not following the right procedure to reproduce the
ndings. Thus, in both cases there is a risk factor in-
volved. To mitigate the risks, the community needs to
advocate for well-documented solid results to ease the
reproducibility process.

Conrming reproducibility requires a substantial amount
of work even the source code is available due to lack of
algorithm details, implementation matters, unavailable
data, gratuitously long running time, etc. Proper incen-
tives are therefore needed to encourage reproducibility.
One incentive is that ones research needs to be repro-
ducible to have high impact. Some questions that need
to be thought of in this regard are as follows. Should we
have explicit seals of reproducibility? Should it be part
of the publication process? Should reviewers check the
code? Should acceptance be conditional on the release
of data and code?

Overall, due to the nature of the computer vision re-
search, in particular its engineering aspect, the problem
of the negative results and replicability is less pressing
compared to biological research. Reporting wrong re-
sults can be detrimental in natural sciences (e.g., clini-
cal and medical research) because it has important im-
plications (lives are on the line). According to a vision
psychologist, Elissa Amino, §if it (a computer vision
algorithm) works, and is working better than everyone
else＊s, it will eventually be made available for everyone
to use. If there was a replication issue, it wouldn＊t get
very far. So, I think in computer vision the discussion

6

is more useful for theoretical advancement, rather than
for replication issues.§

at the given level (e.g., 5% or 1%) of signicance (i.e.,
leading to a conclusion). If the p-value is not less than
the required signicance level, then the test has no re-
sult (not conclusive or negative results). In this case the
evidence is insucient to support a conclusion.

approaches: exploratory analysis (pattern mining) and
to exactly what you had planned to do in advance 1 .
Another way is to conduct randomized out-of-sample
hypothesis testing. In the rst approach, they focus on
running experiments to gather data in searching for hy-
tests. Here, a data set is randomly partitioned into two
subsets. One subset is used for formulating a hypoth-

and distributions＊ means and covariances. Reporting
uncertainty is often neglected in computer vision or is
done in a wrong way [57]. Further, many researchers
misunderstand condence intervals and standard error
bars [58, 59].
Hypothesis tests are used in determining whether
the outcome of a study would lead to a rejection of
the null hypothesis for a pre-specied level of signi-
cance. The null hypothesis represents what is believed
by default, before seeing any evidence. Statistical signif-
icance, p-value, is a probability value indicating whether
the outcome of an experiment can happen accidentally
or not. The smaller the p-value, the larger the signif-
icance. If the p-value is less than the required signi-
cance level, then we say the null hypothesis is rejected

One ma jor challenge when designing experiments is
dealing with confounding factors (a.k.a confounders or
confounding variables). Not controlling the confounding
factors can lead to misleading and useless results. Let
me clarify this with an example. Assume you aim to
investigate the hypothesis that exercise (independent
variable) causes weight loss (dependent variable). Let＊s
say you collect data from 2n sub jects (n in the control
group; who did not exercised) and conclude that indeed

1 §To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may
be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem exami-
nation: he may be able to say what the experiment died of.§ 每

exercise leads to weight loss. Is this a reliable nding?
Maybe not, due to several concerns:

每 Some sub jects (under treatment) might have been
using drugs so the weight loss could be attributed
to that,
每 Control group might have included mostly female or
old sub jects (i.e., unbalanced groups), so gender or
age might be confounding factors,
每 Sub jects in the treatment group might have eaten
less than sub jects in the control group during the
course of the experiment,
每 Some sub jects might have been athletes,
每 Some sub jects might have spent less time exercising
than others,
每 Some sub jects might have eaten immediately after
the exercise while others did not,
每 Etcetera.

In this regard, it is extremely important to under-
stand the dierence between correlation and causation.
For example, shoe size correlates with reading level in
children but it is not the true reason of better read-
ing ability (the true reason might be age or educa-
tion). Another example is the myth in ancient Ger-
many where people believed that storks deliver babies
(See here [64, 65] for a discussion of this). Notice that
these were only few concerns regarding statistical test-
ing. There are, of course, several other factors to be
carefully thought about when running experiments and
statistical testing.
Let me bring two examples related to computer vi-
sion. In the rst example, let＊s say you have designed a
system that tells whether a scene is captured in China
or in the United States 2 . Let＊s assume you test your
model on a dataset that accidentally has people visible
in images taken in China while none of the images taken
in US contain people. Can we say for sure this model is
able to do the task? Not denitively. The reason is that
the model might have discovered that the existence of
a person determines the location where it was taken.
The model may fail when presented with images with
no people in them. In this example, randomly sampling
the data and scaling up the size of the dataset might
mitigate the problem and reduces the bias. In the sec-
ond example, assume you have a model that predicts
whether the resolution of an aerial image is low, inter-
mediate or high. Accidentally, your low-, intermediate-,
and high resolution terrain images come from areas cov-
ered with snow, rock, and vegetation, respectively. Now
your model might have learned to classify dierent re-
gions instead of resolution. All in all, since most of the

computer vision models are data- driven, it is crucial to
understand what aspects of the data they are captur-
ing. This will help explain what models actually learn.

It is becoming increasingly popular to resort to in-
expensive crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon Me-
chanical Turk [66]) to collect annotated data for train-
ing supervised data-hungry models [67]. This has pros
and cons. The pros are a) such large scale datasets pro-
vide more statistical power and are rich for statistical
hypothesis testing, and b) the learned models have high
expressive power (since the stimulus set is a good rep-
resentative of the real world). There are several cons
associated with it as well. Firstly, there is less control
over the stimuli. It is often very cumbersome (some-
times impossible) to inspect all images to see if they
are appropriate. Secondly, there is less control over the
data collection setup. It is hard to tell whether sub jects
are qualied, follow the procedure or are actively en-
gaged in the task. Some strategies have been devised to
ensure a certain degree of data quality including a) se-
cretly injecting some images for which annotations are
already known (a.k.a catch trials), b) designing grading
tasks (e.g., asking workers to grade each other＊s work),
and c) collecting multiple annotations for every image
to reduce noise. Third, due to these uncertainties and
noise in the data it sometimes becomes very challenging
to conduct meaningful statistical tests. For instance, it
is hard to verify the claim that CNNs (e.g., ResNet [ 34])
outperform humans on the ImageNet recognition task.
To harness such problems, cognitive vision researchers
have traditionally been conducting laboratory experi-
ments where they had (almost) full control over the
stimuli and sub jects. But that is about to change due
to the big data revolution. So, as time goes by, hopefully
better ways will emerge to deal with these problems.

Note that not all agree that statistical testing is
needed in computer vision. According to one of the re-
viewers of a prior version of this piece: §... clearly many
of the papers do not require such a test. Indeed, most
computer vision papers presenting an empirical study
are reporting a pre-dened metric on a pre-dened data;
hence, I see no value in a statistical test. Since statis-
tical test is designed to handle unknowns about the
metric and data you choose.§. What I believe is that
sometimes it might be acceptable, to some degree, to
tweak parameters, crunch numbers, etcetera in order
to build an engineering product, but when it comes to
making precise scientic statements, conducting careful
statistical tests becomes inevitable.

6 Dissemination of negative results

Dissemination of positive results is often straightfor-
ward. How about when results do not support a desired
hypothesis or are inconclusive? Here, I discuss the is-
sues surrounding communicating negative results. Some
journals such as PLOS ONE, Journal of Negative Re-
sults in Biomedicine, and Journal of Articles in Support
of the Null Hypothesis explicitly welcome negative, null,
or inconclusive results. As of now, there is no system-
atic way of disseminating negative results in computer
vision. Not only that, but also commentary and opinion
papers like this one are often not welcome as journals
prefer technical papers.

Computer vision has a unique model of publication.
While there are several prestigious journals (e.g., IEEE
PAMI, IJCV, CVIU, IVC) to publish the results, top-
tier conferences are where the real action happens (e.g.,
CVPR, ICCV, ECCV). A large number of papers are
submitted to these conferences and get reviewed in a
short period of time (around 3 months with the net
reviewing period varying from 1 to 2 months). These
conferences are very competitive (acceptance rate rang-
ing from 20% to 30%) thus leaving place only for novel,
interesting and often positive results. Although, once
in a while interesting negative results appear in these
conferences, researchers usually do not risk conducting
such studies. Some conferences (ICLR and NIPS; pub-
lishing some vision papers) have recently adopted an
open review system where the communications between
the reviewers and the authors are made available to the
public. While this does not directly address publishing
negative results, it is an eective way to disclose the
hidden chunk of knowledge to the scientic community.
Unfortunately, vision conferences have not yet adopted
this platform. The reason might be protecting ideas and
ongoing eorts.

ArXiv and blogs (e.g., [68]) are two rising venues
for publication. Both, however, suer from a lack of
peer review. One advantage of ArXiv is rapid distribu-
tion of ndings. One drawback is that sometimes pa-
pers are early half-baked progress reports often pub-
lished to claim an idea. Blogs allow personal opinions
and discussions in an informal setting (i.e., conversa-
tions). Although very interesting, such a venue includes
folk, sporadic, and noisy thoughts. Nevertheless, occa-
sionally people exploit these venues for communication
or settling a matter. For example, I came across an
ArXiv paper [69] debating the results of a previously
peer-reviewed published paper [70] which introduced a
new biologically-inspired method for mitigating the ad-
versarial perturbations in CNNs.

An important concern in publishing negative results
is giving a fair chance to the original authors (especially
in cases where published results are questioned) to re-
spond to the counter arguments. Journals seem to be
a better option for such discussions and open debates.
Some elds have already devised eective strategies for
dealing with this concern. For example, the Journal of
Behavioral and Brain Sciences (BBS) invites other sci-
entists to comment on an accepted paper. The paper
and the corresponding comments then get published to-
gether in the same issue of the journal. Journal of Vision
and Journal of Vision Research publish commentary
and re-analysis papers (sometimes discussing the neg-
ative results) as the §letters to the editor§ (See [ 71] as
an example). In all of these journals, all materials have
to go through the peer review process. These practices
enrich the scholarly work.
One point to stress here is that negative results
should go through a thorough review process. Consider-
ing the intense race for publication, it only make sense
to accept negative results that address problems which
are important, challenging, and of high interest to the
community. What we certainly do not need is a replete
of negative results (or early progress reports) ending
up in arXiv occupying the limited bandwidth of re-
searchers.
How about publishing inconclusive results? I believe
that such results are indeed publishable and treating
them separately is hard. This is because obtaining a
purely negative result in a data-driven discipline is puz-
zling since it needs to probe the entire parameter space
and inspect lots of design choices.
One of the most eective habits in computer vision
is sharing code and data which has contributed tremen-
dously to the progresses of the eld and has been right-
fully incentivized by high number of references to such
works (similar to benchmark papers). Not only has this
habit proven to be extremely useful to deal with repli-
cability issues and speeding up contributions, it also
serves as a good model for incentivizing negative re-
sults.
In addition to ArXiv and blogs, some other possibili-
ties for publishing negative results are through special-
ized journals, conferences and workshops to the topic
(e.g., http://negative.vision/) where papers can be pre-
sented and discussed in detail.

7 Epilogue

Here I summarize the main take-away lessons from this
work.

每 Firstly, solid, mature, trustworthy, important, in-
teresting, well-documented, and peer-reviewed neg-
ative results that come from rigorous investigations
should certainly be welcome. Such results (conclu-
sive or inconclusive) can save a lot of eorts by pre-
venting redundant eorts, add to the intellectual
richness of the community, promote scholarly cul-
ture, and give tremendous insights regarding limits
of models, datasets, and evaluation scores. One chief
concern here is that hastily-derived and half-baked
negative results can be dangerous and misleading.
Notice that it is usually easier to obtain a negative
result than a positive result (e.g., making a model
work). What is very important, even more than sign,
is the validity of the outcome. Overall, negativity
towards negative results is counterproductive and
such results should be published provided that they
follow appropriate and sound scientic methodolo-
gies.
每 Second, negative results should be properly and ef-
fectively disseminated, incentivized, shared, encour-
aged and discussed. Absence of negative results from
the literature can cause serious problems (e.g., bi-
asing researchers in certain directions). A mindset
needs to be nurtured and encouraged to recognize
and embrace such eorts (e.g., through dedicated
journals and conferences to the topic). Emphasizing
the statement by Torralba and Efros [72] that §too
much value (is given) to winning a particular chal-
lenge§, negative results as well as smart baselines
can be as important as algorithm development or
dataset collection and should be given a fair chance
to be presented in conferences and journals. To this
end, we may need to change the mindset on a larger
scale (e.g., funding agencies). Also, negative results
should be disseminated in such a way that the orig-
inal authors can get a chance to respond (in case of
replication failure). If possible, it would be more ef-
fective to make the comments and discussions avail-
able to community.
每 Third, statistical testing has been undermined in
computer vision and should be taken into account
in the future. Several factors need to be carefully
taken into account in conducting statistical testing
including selection of the appropriate tests, control-
ling for confounding factors, compensating for mul-
tiple comparisons, etc. Statistical testing should be
also exploited in model comparisons. This is even
more important when models start to saturate on
a dataset raising the question of whether a 1% im-
provement in accuracy is meaningful. Overall, sta-
tistical analysis becomes increasingly more impor-
tant as computer vision methods hit the market

9

and become prevalent in daily life. Statistical anal-
ysis is also critical to support hypotheses and ad-
vance vision sciences. In this regard, students and
computer vision researchers should be encouraged
to strengthen their knowledge of statistics.
每 Fourth, multi-disciplinary aspect of computer vision
should be emphasized. Negative results and statis-
tical testing are where the eld can clearly learn
a lot from from other elds, biological sciences in
particular. To implement this, events that promote
such emphasis should be encouraged (e.g., inter-
disciplinary tutorials and workshops in conferences,
publication of interdisciplinary papers, invited talks,
etc). In this respect, a synergy between computer
and human vision can pay o well in the future.
According to Rama Chellappa [73] §it is counter-
productive if one or more groups of researchers to
claim that their view of the elephant is the best
one. Putting all our eort together, hopefully we
can come up with a general solution to the grand
problem of vision.§ This is particularly important in
the age of deep learning where biologically-inspired
neural networks have demonstrated a great promise.
每 Fifth, perhaps less related to the main focus of this
writing, is a concern on research attitude. Computer
vision is enjoying a great phase of expansion and
success. It might be even one of the fastest grow-
ing areas in computer science, thanks to industry
backup. This has brought along a certain culture
which is described well by Geman and Geman in
§Science in the age of Seles§ [74]. These authors
argue that researchers spend much of their time an-
nouncing ideas rather than formulating them. This
partly has to be blamed on distractions caused by
high information ow, web, social media, etc. Con-
tributing to these, is the fact that researchers are re-
warded for publishing more frequently than higher
quality papers which has encouraged researchers to
look for §minimum publishable units.§ This has led
to a point that an overwhelmingly high number of
publications appear each year making it practically
impossible to track the progress even for senior sci-
entists, let alone the newcomers. This concern has
been raised by Alan Yuille [75]: §The conference cy-
cle while adding dynamism often leads to a focus on
short-term research, an emphasis on ＊sound-bytes＊,
and often small progress, improvements in perfor-
mance on benchmarked datasets 每 rather than long-
term quality research. This disrupts the balance be-
tween short-term research 每 picking the low-hanging
fruit 每 and long-term research which builds the tools
to pick the rest. We suggest reestablishing journal
publications with rigorous peer review as the ＊gold

10

standard＊ for referencing, for awarding prizes, for
faculty appointments, and promotions.§ We should
certainly benet from relatively less emphasis on
quantity of publications and relatively greater em-
phasis on quality of research. We need to openly
and frankly discuss this in the community to nd
appropriate remedies.
