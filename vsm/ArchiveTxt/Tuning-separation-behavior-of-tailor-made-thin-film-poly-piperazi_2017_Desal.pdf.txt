abstract

The present study describes some appealing results concerning the TFC membrane performances prepared by
varying the solvents of piperizine (viz. water, acetonitrile and water-acetonitrile). The membrane selectivity of
bivalent over mono-valent anions reduces from water N acetonitrile-water N acetonitrile (i.e. Memb-I N Memb-
II N Memb-III). The partition co-efcient values support the trend. The retention order of salts is
Na2SO4 N MgSO4 N MgCl2 N CaCl2 N NaCl. pH dependence separation study shows different behaviors for NaCl,
Na2SO4 and MgSO4. Memb-I and II show minimum NaCl separation at pH 7 whereas in acidic and alkaline medi-
um it is increasing trend, but Memb-III shows differences in alkaline pH. On the contrary Memb-I and II show im-
provement in retention with pH for Na2SO4 and MgSO4, whereas Memb-III shows the fall in retention at alkaline
pH. The separation performance of diuron and isoproturon follows order Risoproturon(90.95%) N Rdiuron(79.34%) for
Memb-II at pH 7. The separation performances follow the trend Memb-II N Memb-I N Memb-III. It reects that
acetonitrile-water mixture for piperizine optimizes maximum permeability as well as a charge of the membrane.
The higher retention of isoproturon at alkaline pH is explained by higher molecular size and low polarity com-
pared to diuron. The low separation trend of diuron at higher pH may be explained by relatively more polarity
and low molecular size.

1. Introduction

The growing global need for water and waste water treatment has
driven the widespread development of membrane ltration processes.
The membrane is not new to the step of availability of fresh water.
The enormous history of membranes and made to order different
ltration set up. Fast forward to present era. From ever-evolving orders
for desalination to waste water treatment, the membranes take the
footsteps.
The potential ability of these membranes to remove pesticides is dic-
tated by °Æwater reuse°Ø strategy. Water contamination occurs generally
occurs as a consequence of using herbicides in agricultural activities.
Much advancement of technological efforts has been taking place in
the agricultural world. The adverse effects on human health are serious
concern. Since water is one of the vehicles to transport in the food chain,
scientists and technologists have the target to purify water from it.

For the last few decades, scientists have explored simple methodol-
ogies to transform available polymers into materials with excellent
properties and applications. In this regard °ÆThin lm composite°Ø mem-
brane is a milestone in separation science [1,2].
Thin lm composite membranes are a class of macromolecular fea-
tures formed by the interfacial polymerization on the asymmetric mem-
brane support. The attractiveness of selected °Æthin lm composite
membrane°Ø system stems from several factors. The most important
one is undoubtedly the chemical and thermal stabilities of these relative
to other conventional polymers; the simple preparation and the possi-
bility to prepare categories which have a range of appealing perfor-
mances. Many signicant developments have been taken place in the
past few decades regarding the preparation of thin lm composite
membranes in the world. The beauty of this technique is that it occurs
at low temperature and does not require a catalyst. There are two
main controlling steps in this particular membrane formation viz. prep-
aration of asymmetric polysulfone membranes, polyamide formation
through interfacial polymerization. Research works have been carried
out by varying conditions (viz. Varying different amine, pH of amine so-
lution, coating conditions, mixing of additives, solvents of acid chloride)
to prepare tailor made membranes [3®C9]. Reports are also available in
terms of addition of different solvents (viz. dimethyl formamide, di-
methyl sulfoxide) to the aqueous amine system to modify the cross-
linked structure of m-phenylne diamine and trimesoyl chloride [7,10,
11].
In our study, an interfacial polymerization reaction has been used to
prepare poly(piperazine-amide) (polyamide) membrane formation on
Polysulfone support. The interfacial polymerization in our study was
performed on water/acetonitrile- hexane interface. The technique can
synthesize and attach functional materials on to Polysulfone surfaces
by the polymerization reaction between hydrophilic piperizine
(C4N2H12), a secondary amine and N-heterocyclic one and hydrophobic
1,3,5 trimesoyl chloride (C9H3Cl3O3), multifunctional monomer at
water/acetonitrile-hexane interface. The unique feature of
the
poly(piperazine-amide) membrane membranes is that it can provide
more free volume to the skin, poly(piperazine-amide) layer because of
its low energy of its chair conformation [12]. Thus it can be suitable
for organics separation.
With the aim of observing the effect of partition coefcient for the
interfacial polymerization the experiment is carried out by adopting a
single strategy. The diamine is interfacially polymerized to polyamide,
by changing its solvent, i.e. water, acetonitrile and a mixture of acetoni-
trile/water. This paper investigates the use of acetonitrile in the interfa-
cial polymerization of cross-linked polyamide. The separation proles in
terms of salt and organic markers are also descriptors for the mem-
branes. The selectivity of bivalent over monovalent ratios is interesting
for poly(piperazine-amide) membrane. It is our study to compare the
separation performance study of all tailor-made membranes of bivalent
salts over monovalent ones [13]

reaction is preferably at the hexane phase because of the low availability
in aqueous phase similar to 1.3 phenylene diamine - trimesoyl chloride
studied earlier [16]. The polyamide was cured at 100 °„C for 4 min. The
same reaction was also conducted using piperizine in acetonitrile-
water (1:1) mixture and acetonitrile. The membrane is termed as
Memb-I, Memb-II and Memb-III as in Table 2.
Thus three layer thin lm composites were prepared. The schematic
diagram is presented in Fig. 2. The top ultrathin layer is responsible for
ion/molecule selectivity. Below the top ultrathin layer, the porous sub
layer asymmetric in nature controls the feed ow as well as provided
surface which accommodate polyamide thin layer. The macrovoid po-
rous sublayer increases the mass transfer [17]. The third layer is a
non-woven polyester fabric which holds the mechanical strength of
the whole membrane.

2.4. Permeability studies

Permeation experiments were carried out by crossow ltration
technique at 1.034 MPa pressure. The cross-ow ltration setup is
shown in our previous study [18]. Four pressure cells made of SS-316
are in a series. There was perforated support on which membrane was
placed. TFC membrane was compacted 1 h before taking separation
data. The effective membrane surface area in each cell was
0.00152 m2. The salt (viz. NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4, CaCl2, and MgCl2) con-
centrations were kept at 1000 mg/L. The molecular descriptors (viz. glu-
cose, sucrose) were prepared (500 mg/L). The synthetic waste water
was prepared with herbicides (viz. diuron, isoproturon) (2 mg/L). All
the experiments are carried out in deionized water.
The permeate ux (Jv) was calculated by.

where Jv is expressed in lm 2 h 1, V (in litre) is the permeate volume,

2.5. Analytical methods

The chemical structures of the membranes were analyzed by Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy using attenuated total reectance at-
tachment (FTIR-ATR, Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX, Norwalk,CT with reso-
lution of °¿ 4 cm 1). The powder samples with KBr crystal (1:50) were
taken for the measurements. The crosslinked polyamide powder sam-
ples were obtained by dipping crosslinked poly(piperazine-amide)
membranes into NN dimethyl formamide. The polysulfone was dis-
solved in the solvent and poly(piperazine-amide) was separated out.
The polyamide was then centrifuged and collected for the analysis. Con-
tact angle of the membranes were carried out by sessile drop method
(DSA 100, KRUSS, Germany) at 25 °„C. The capture of water contact
angle was 15 s. The zeta potential (¶∆) was determined with the electro-
kinetic analyzer (Zeta-CAD, France (version 1.04) based on the stream-
ing potential method using at sheet's of the membrane material
(5 °¡ 3 cm) in a commercial plate taking 1 mM KCl as background elec-
trolyte. X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical Empyrean), Cu K ¶¡ radiation
as monochromator was used to prove the changes the relative amor-
phous character for polyamide powders from the respective mem-
branes. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of the samples
were taken using JSM-7100 F. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images
of the samples were acquired using NT-MDT, Russia AFM instrument.
XPS core-level spectra were taken with an Omicron Multiprobe (Omi-
cron NanoTechnology GmbH, UK) spectrometer tted with an EA125
hemispherical analyzer. A monochromated Al K¶¡ X-ray source operated
at 150 W was used for the experiments. The analyzer pass energy was
kept xed at 40 eV for all the scans. As the samples are insulating in na-
ture, a low energy electron gun (SL1000, Omicron) with a large spot size
was used to neutralize the samples. The potential of the electron gun

3. Results and discussion

In our experiment of wet phase separation process N,N-dimethyl
formamide-water and polysulfone-N,N-dimethyl formamide dimixing
in polysulfone/N,N-dimethyl formamide/water plays the key role in
thin skin layer formation supported by porous structure. The phase sep-
aration occurs due to lowering of Gibbs free energy mixing because of
the diffusion exchange of N,N-dimethyl formamide (solvent) and
water (nonsolvent) across the interface of the casting solution [19®C21].
The interfacial polymerization occurs on the asymmetric
polysulfone support. The adsorption of diamine from its solution is be-
cause of the afnity of polysulfone towards diamine. This may be polar-
ity due to the presence of

membranes (Memb-I,
II and III) as well as virgin asymmetric
Polysulfone membranes (PS), which is quite smooth. The polyamide
shows like to disperse particles over the surface from Memb-I to
Memb-III. The behavior is prominent from Memb-I to Mem-III. More-
over, the dispersed particles are in accumulated form in Memb-III. The
cross-section view is also interesting. The asymmetric structure is well
reected in Polysulfone (B). The asymmetric structure is rather com-
pressed from Memb-I to Memb-III. The growth of nodular shaped on
the surface is seen in the Mem-III. These results are consistent in rough-
ness parameters from Atomic Force Micrograph (Table 1). The micro-
graphs are in the ensemble (Fig. 7). There is quite an appreciable
difference in roughness between Memb-I and Memb-III.
Fig. 8 shows that Polysulfone is amorphous in character and presents
one wide, weak broad peak at around 18°„ and similar to report by Ionita
et al. [30].
The polyamides prepared from piperizine and trimesoyl chloride
shows less amorphous character compared to polysulfone. The pattern
is the signature of the amorphous character of polyamides. Though
there is not prominent difference, the relative amorphous character of
polyamide powder is Memb-I N Memb-II N Memb-III.
Contact angle studies (Table 2) show that Polysulfone membrane is
hydrophobic. The polyamide coating on the polysulfone membrane
makes them hydrophilic. The hydrophilicity trend is Memb-

III N Memb-II N Memb-I. The contact angle of Memb-III is not measur-
able. It shows spreading of water droplets over the membrane surface.

3.1. Separation of electrolytes

The performance of salt separation depends on the charge bears
with membrane. The separation of electrolytes is discussed through dif-
ferent models [31]. The selectivity of bivalent over monovalent salts for
poly(piperazine-amide) thin lm composite membrane is already re-
ported and explained in our report by density functional theory exper-
iment [2,13,32].
The most promising model concept is based on Nernst Planck Equa-
tion, in which the total separation of electrolytes contribution attributed
to electrical, diffusion and convection forces.
It is understood that when electrolyte is in contact with ®Cvely
charged membrane, the counter ions are in the vicinity of the mem-
brane which forms the Donnan potential between the concentration
difference of ions at the boundary between the membrane and bulk so-
lution. Because of the Donnan potential the counter ions is attracted to-
wards the membrane where as co-ions rejection takes place. Higher
Donnan potential reects higher salt rejection of the membrane [33,34].
The separation contribution comes from the hindrance of mem-
branes to diffuse the ionic solute and solvent through it. In case of

pore dimensions are of similar order to that of the solute molecule, the
apparent diffusion co-efcient of the solute is much lower than that in
bulk solution [31,35] whereas the convective hindrance to ow through
it depends on the ionic radius and pore size.
The separations of different electrolytes are also in ensemble (Fig. 9
and Table 4). The charge, lower diffusion co-efcient, higher size (SO4
1.06 °¡ 10 9 m2/s, 0.23 nm) (Cl 2.01 °¡ 10 9 m2/s, 0.12 nm) play role
in case of Na2SO4 N NaCl and MgSO4 N MgCl2 separation. The higher dif-
fusivity and lower size facilitates the permeation of Na+ and thus the

rejection of NaCl is lowest. On the other hand low diffusivity and higher
size of Mg2+ added the contribution of rejection of MgCl2 and thus the
ratio of Na2SO4/NaCl is higher than MgSO4/MgCl2 [34,36®C38]. The hy-
drated size factor of the cations also plays the role in case of
MgCl2 N CaCl2. It is well understood that the high retention of salts (bi-
valent co-ion + monovalent counter ion) and the lower retention of
salts (bivalent counter ion + monovalent co-ion) from the Donnan ex-
clusion model. The order of rejection of all the studied salts is
Na2SO4 N MgSO4 N MgCl2 N CaCl2 N NaCl. The same trend was observed
for different commercial membranes reported by researchers [36,39].
The adsorption of Mg2+ on the membrane lowers the zeta potential of
the membrane and thus the order suggests MgCl2 N NaCl. Similar behav-
ior was also seen in literature [16,37,39,40]. The diffusivity and size fac-
tor supports the order. (DMgCl2: 1.24 °¡ 10 9 m2/s b DNaCl:
1.6 °¡ 10 9 m2/s) and (rs (Mg
) 0.18 nm). All the rejec-
tion trend of salts is similar to all the three membranes. The selectivity
of bivalent to monovalent salts (SO4
=/Cl) decreases from Membrane I
(1.95) to Membrane III (1.35). It can correlate with the decrease in
zeta potential of the membranes. With the acetonitrile system, it dimin-
ishes the selectivity ratio as well as ux compared to aqueous one.
Regarding cationic separation of membranes, the cations with low
diffusivities and higher pore size have the better rejection. In this regard
the general retention order is Mg2+ N Ca2+ N Na+. The Mg2 + (in
MgSO4) has better permeation than Mg2+ (in MgCl2). Na+ (in
Na2SO4) has better permeation than Na+ (in NaCl). In the ®Cvely charged
nanoltration membrane the repulsive force acts on the co-ions (anion)
and attractive force acts on counter-ions (cations). Divalent anion (SO4
=)
shows the higher charge effect compared to monovalent anion (Cl)
and they are unable to pass through the membrane. But the oppositely
charged divalent counter ions have no difculty in passing through the
membrane.
The zeta potential (¶∆) varies with pH (Fig. 3). The pH dependence of
the zeta potential gives information on the acidic and basic strength of
the surface charge groups. In the alkaline range it shows negative plateu
for the membranes I, II and III. This is due to the dissociation of acidic
( COOH) surface groups. The repulsive force between the ®Cve charge
and the co-ion results higher rejection. At acidic pH (pH 3.5), the
amino group being protonated and generates a positive charge on the
membrane as the zeta potential suggests. The repulsive force between
the Na+ and membrane shows the higher rejection compared to neutral
pH. This trend is same for Memb-I and Memb-II. Though the charged
membranes repel co-ions (i.e. same sign of charge as the membrane
charge) by the electric repulsive force, the cations couldn't be in the
feed side independently, it will be there maintaining electro neutrality.
Fig. 10 show the performance variation with pH. In case of Na2SO4,
the pH effect is same for Memb-I and Memb-II in the alkaline range as
NaCl. Only the extent is small, as the retention has already reached
95% at normal pH. In acidic condition, the pH effect shows opposite
with respect to NaCl rejection. It may be a higher anionic charge pos-
sessed by SO4
=. Thus the repulsive force between membrane and SO4
operates unlike in NaCl. The same trend is observed for MgSO4 for the
two membranes Memb-I and Memb-II.
But for Memb-III the opposite effect is observed in the alkaline pH
region in all three salts (NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4). The lower rejection of
co-ion may be due to the excess counter-ion (viz. Na+, Mg2+) in the vi-
cinity of the membrane which may lower the negative charge on it. At
alkaline pH, OH retention is much more (salt rejection is less). Thus
the H + concentration in the permeate is much more and pH will be
less. The pH changed to 8.5 from feed pH 9.51 for NaCl. The variation
is not so much prominent with respect to three membranes. The reec-
tion is a little bit more in case of other two salts (viz. 8.3 from pH 9.51 for
Na2SO4 and MgSO4).
In acidic condition nitrogen being protonated on the membrane,
there is the possibility of electrostatic repulsion between the positive
charge on the membrane and H+ in the feed and results shrinkage of
pores. Results showed that there is no signicant variation in ux. In

+

=

acidic pH, the protonated amino group takes the initiative. It repels H+
in the feed. Thus permeate pH will be enhanced (3.51 to 5.95 for NaCl in
case of Memb-I). For Memb-II and III the effect will slightly different be-
cause of the variation of the amino group present on the membrane. It
follows the same trend in the case of other two salts.

3.2. Separation of organics

Thin lm polyamide composite membranes become increasingly
popular in organic separation from water. Glucose, sucrose is taken as

molecular descriptors. Molecular weight is primarily used parameter
reecting molecular size, although it is not a direct measure of molecu-
lar size. The separation study shows that Rsucrose N Rglucose. Fig. 11 shows
the effect of pH in terms of separation performance for the membranes.
At high pH condition the membranes are more negatively charged as
the zeta potential value suggests and glucose in glucosate form [41].
The electrostatic repulsion between membrane and the ions in-
creases and it leads to shrinkage of pores. It results higher retention
and lower ux in alkaline pH. In acidic pH, the membranes are showing
lower zeta potential because of the undissociated carboxyl groups as
well as adsorption of protons [42].
Thus, the shrinkage occurs of the nodule entity of the polymeric in-
built structure and shows enlargement of pores. It results low retention.
The separation performances for three membranes are compared and
follows the trend Memb-II N Memb-III N Memb-I. The acetonitrile-
water (1:1) mixture of piperizine in the interfacial polymerization reac-
tion optimizes the permeability as well as the charge factor of Memb-II.
Fig. 12 shows the variation of separation performance with pH. The
trend shows that isoproturon have higher separation data with respect
to diuron. These ndings can be explained from the molecular size as
well as polarity, ensemble in Table 1. The lower molecular size as well
as relatively high polarity facilitates diuron to pass through all the

charged membranes. Similar separation performance order for three
membranes is Memb-II N Memb-III N Memb-I. The maximum rejection
of diuron for our membrane (Memb-II, having 68.7% NaCl rejection) is
79.34% compared to Film tech (Dow) membrane, having 75% NaCl re-
jection which shows 87% rejection almost same pressure [43].
The separation performance of diuron (having relatively higher di-
pole moment) in higher pH decreases, as there are the possibilities to
pass through the membranes having zeta potential relatively more neg-
ative. The statistical population of polar molecules near the vicinity of
charged membrane increases and thus there are the chances to pass
through the membranes [44]. The rejection difference is not very
much reected for Memb-I, which is more porous, reected from its
ux. The relatively low polarity of isoproturon as well as higher molec-
ular size follows the reverse trend, i.e. at higher pH the separation
increases.
In acidic pH these two urea herbicides exist as cationic species
(DH+) as shown [45] and the membranes show positively charged as
zeta potential suggests. The repulsive interactions for higher size
isoproturon may be the possible explanation for the increase in separa-
tion. But, in case of diuron may be widening of pores in acidic condition
is the reason for decrement in separation.

4. Conclusions

Thin lm polyamide composite membranes were prepared through
interfacial polymerization varying piperizine solvent (viz. water, acetoni-
trile-water, acetonitrile) with trimesoyl chloride in hexane. The difference
is due to the partition co-efcient of piperizine in these solvents with hex-
ane. Though the separation of salts follows the order Memb-III to Memb-I,
the selectivity of bivalent to monovalent salts (SO4
=/Cl) decreases from
Memb-I to Memb-III i.e. varying solvents water N acetonitrile-water N
acetonitrile. The pH dependence salt separation effect is quite different
for three membranes. The separation at its minimum for NaCl at pH 7,
whereas it show an increasing trend in acidic as well as alkaline pH. All

three membranes show decreasing trend for Na2SO4 and MgSO4 separa-
tion in acidic pH. Memb-III shows detrimental effect in alkaline pH may
be due to counter-ion effect as well as competitive OH effect.
The organics separation performance order for the three membranes
is Memb-II N Memb-I N Memb-III. The physical properties of the feed or-
ganics also show their order (Rsucrose N Rglucose) (Risoproturon N Rdiuron) for
the same membranes. The difference in pH effect is because of the polar-
ity and molecular size difference along with the nature of the mem-
branes. The isoproturon separation is in increasing trend in high and
low pH where as diuron suffers a detrimental effect for Memb-II and
Memb-III.
