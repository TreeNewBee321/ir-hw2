abstract

This paper investigates the problem of detecting a multichannel signal when subspace signal mismatch 
occurs. A new detector is proposed, which is obtained by weighting two existing detectors, namely, the 
subspace-based adaptive matched lter and adaptive subspace detector. The proposed weighted detec- 
tor has exibility in controlling its capability of rejection mismatched subspace signals. Specically, its 
robustness (or selectivity) for mismatched subspace signals improves as the weight value increases (or 
decreases). Closed-form expressions for the probabilities of detection and false alarm are derived. The 
theoretical results are conrmed by Monte Carlo simulations.

1. Introduction 

Detection of a signal embedded in noise is a common prob- 
lem in the eld of signal processing. Kelly was the rst adopting 
the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to multichannel sig- 
nal detection [1] . Then Chen et al. [2] and Robey et al. [3] in- 
dependently derive the adaptive matched lter (AMF), which has 
lower complexity than the KGLRT. For the same detection prob- 
lem in [1] , De Maio derives the Rao test, denoted as De Maio¡¯s 
Rao (DMRao) [4] . The DMRao provides better performance than 
the KGLRT and AMF in rejecting mismatched signals. Note that 
these three detectors are designed in homogeneous environment, 
where the test and training data have the same noise covariance 
matrix. In [5] , the detection problem in partially homogeneous en- 
vironment is exploited and the adaptive coherence estimate (ACE) 
is proposed therein. For partially homogeneous environment, the 
test and training data share the same covariance matrix up to an 
unknown scaling factor. Recently, many different kinds of detection 
problems are investigated and a large number of detectors are pro- 
posed, such as [6¨C16] and the references therein. 
The detectors mentioned above are mainly devised in the ab- 
sence of signal mismatch. However, signal mismatch often hap- 
pens due to array errors, pointing errors, and wavefront distortions 
[17] . It is worth noting that robust detectors are not always pre- 
ferred [17] . For example, when a target is located in the sidelobe of 
the radar beam, there is mismatch between the target bearing and 
radar beam steering. Hence, it is often desirable to reject this side- 
lobe target (for the purpose of target localization) and wait until it 
enters into the main beam. As a result, in some practical applica- 
tions one needs a detector which can balance the robustness and 
selectivity [18] . The capability of a detector to reject or detect mis- 
matched signals is referred to as the directivity [19] . In the open 
literature there are mainly two kinds of methods to make trade- 
off between robustness and selectivity. One is the two-stage de- 
tection scheme. A two-stage detector is constructed by cascading 
two detectors, which usually behave quite differently in the case 
1 to signal 
of signal mismatch. Precisely, one detector is selective 
mismatch, while the other is robust to signal mismatch. The two- 
stage detector have two detection thresholds. By tuning the pair 
of detection thresholds for a xed probability of false alarm (PFA), 
the two-stage detector achieves exible robustness to mismatched 
signals. The well-known two-stage detectors are the adaptive side- 
lobe blanker (ASB) [20] , the two-stage detector cascading the AMF 
and KGLRT [21] , the two-stage Rao test cascading of the AMF and 
DMRao [4] , the so-called WAS-ASB cascading the subspace-based 
GLRT (SGLRT) and whited-adaptive beamforming orthogonal rejec- 
tion test (W-ABORT) [22] , the subspace-based ASB (S-ASB) cascad- 
ing the SGLRT and ACE [23] , the so-called KWAS-ASB cascading the 
SGLRT and KWA [24] , and the two-stage Rao test cascading the 
SGLRT and DMRao [25] . More recently, a review of two-stage de- 
tectors is given in [19] . The other kind of method to solve the de- 

1 A selective detector is less tolerant to signal mismatch. When signal mismatch 
occurs, the probability of detection (PD) of a selective rapidly decreases. 
tection problem in the presence of signal mismatch is the tunable 
detector (or called the parametric detector). The tunable detector 
is parameterized by a scalar, referred to as the tunable parame- 
ter. By changing the tunable parameter, the tunable detector can 
smoothly varying from a robust detector to a selective one. Many 
tunable detectors have been proposed, such as the tunable detec- 
tor given in [26] , the KWA [24] , the KRAO [27] , and the KMABORT 
[28] . 
Note that all the two-stage detectors and tunable detectors 
mentioned above are designed for rank-one signals, which have 
known signal steering vectors. However, in many applications the 
actual signal may be naturally a subspace signal, such as the po- 
larimetric signal [29] , which belongs to a known subspace but with 
unknown coordinates. Signal mismatch can also arise for subspace 
signals, due to the same reasons for rank-one signals. Subspace sig- 
nal mismatch is dened as the phenomenon that the actual signal 
does not fully lie in the presumed subspace. Very limited works 
are done for subspace signal mismatch. In particular, several robust 
detectors are devised in [30¨C32] for subspace signal mismatch. 
However, a robust detector is not always a desirable choice. 
In this paper, a kind of approach to signal detection in the pres- 
ence of mismatched subspace signals is introduced. A new detec- 
tor is constructed by weighting the subspace-based AMF (SAMF) 
[33] and adaptive subspace detector (ASD) [34] . For convenience, 
the proposed weighted detector is referred to as the SAMF-ASD. 
Note that the SAMF and ASD behave quite differently when sub- 
space signal mismatch happens. Precisely, the SAMF is very robust, 
while the ASD is quite selective. As a consequence, the proposed 
SAMF-ASD is of great exibility in controlling the detection perfor- 
mance for mismatched subspace signals. By adjusting the weight, 
the proposed SAMF-ASD can smoothly vary from a robust detector 
to a selective one. Analytical expressions for the PD and PFA are 
derived, which are veried by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the 
problem formulation and presents the proposed weighted detector. 
Section 3 shows the derivations of the analytical expressions for 
the PD and PFA in the case of subspace signal mismatch. Numerical 
examples are given in Section 4 . Finally, Section 5 summarizes the 
paper. 

2. Problem formulation and the proposed weighted detector 

For a binary hypothesis test, one needs to make a decision 
between signal-presence and signal-absence choices. Denote the 
¡Á 1 vector x . Under the signal-absence hy- 
test data by an N 
pothesis H 0 
, x can be expressed as x 
 where n is the noise, 
subjected to a zero-mean complex circular Gaussian distribution, 
with an unknown positive denite covariance matrix 
2 R t . Under 
the signal-presence hypothesis H 1 
, x 
 where s is the sig- 
¡Á p signal matrix H 
¦È . The N 
nal component with the form s 
is known full-column-rank, whose columns span the nominal sub- 
¡Á 1 vector 
space where the signal is assumed to lie, and the p 
¦È is 
deterministic but unknown, standing for the corresponding coordi- 
nate. In summary, the detection problem can be written symboli- 
cally as

Note that the noise covariance matrix R t is unknown in prac- 
tice. In order to estimate R t , a set of independent and identi- 
cally distributed (IID) training data is needed, denoted by x l 
, l

does not contain any signal but

[35] , one can obtain the SAMF

Remarkably, the SAMF is very robust to subspace signal mis-

bustness of the SAMF or the selectivity of the ASD cannot be ex- 
ibly adjusted. Hence, a new detector is designed in this paper by 
weighting the SAMF and ASD, i.e.,

Obviously, the SAMF-ASD with

SAMF-ASD with 
 1 degenerates into the SAMF. An immediate 
remark on the proposed weighted detector is that it possesses the 
CFAR property with respect to the noise covariance matrix R , since 
the SAMF and ASD are both CFAR 
3 [33,34] . Moreover, the proposed 
SAMF-ASD is invariant with respect to the group of transforma- 
tions dened in [37] .

3. Statistical performance of the SAMF-ASD 

This section exploits the statistical performance of the SAMF- 
ASD in the presence of subspace signal mismatch, for which the 
actual signal, say s 0 
, does not completely lie in the subspace 
spanned by the nominal signal matrix H . The PD of the SAMF-ASD 
can be expressed as

match between the training and the test data. However, in this paper, it mainly 
focuses on the case of homogeneous environment.

To obtain the expressions for the PD and PFA of the SAMF-ASD, 
the statistical dependence of the SAMF and ASD on the SGLRT and 
a loss factor is used. The statistical distributions of the SGLRT and 
the loss factor in the case of subspace signal mismatch are given 
in [36] . The detection statistic of the SGLRT is [38]

Numerical examples are given in this section to demonstrate 
the detection performance of the proposed SAMF-ASD. For inde- 
pendent verication of the derived expressions for the PD and PFA, 
Monte Carlo simulations are provided, besides the theoretical re- 
sults. For the MC simulations, 10

run to evaluate the PD and detection threshold, respectively. The

results highlight that the PD of the SAMF-ASD rst increases and 
then decreases with the increase of the weight. The SAMF-ASD has 
the same detection performance as the ASD and SAMF at 
and 
 respectively. This is because the SAMF-ASD reduces to 
the ASD and SAMF at the corresponding values of 
¦Á . A remarkable 
feature is that the SAMF-ASD achieves slightly better detection per- 
formance than the SAMF and ASD in the range of 0.7 
¦Á in the absence of signal mismatch is 
in this example. The best 
the one with which the weighted detector SAMF-ASD provides the 
¦Á is 
highest PD. Unfortunately, an explicit expression for the best 
unavailable. Alternatively, we can use the closed-form expression 
¦Á which 
for the PD given in (31) to numerically search the best 
achieves the highest PD. 
Fig. 3 plots the PD of the SAMF-ASD under different SNRs in 
the case of no signal mismatch. The weight 
¦Á is chosen as 0.83 for 
the SAMF-ASD. For comparison purposes, the PDs of the SAMF and 
ASD are also shown. For the SAMF-ASD, the dashed line denotes 
the theoretical result, while the symbol circle stands for MC re- 
sult. The results highlight that the theoretical PD of the SAMF-ASD 
is in good agreement with the MC simulation, and the proposed 
weighted detector with 
 83 outperforms the SAMF and ASD. 
Fig. 4 demonstrates the detection performance of the SAMF- 
ASD with the weight as a parameter when subspace signal mis- 
match arises. The SNR is set to be 24 dB. For the curves of the 
SAMF-ASD, the dashed line, dotted line, and dash-dotted line stand 
for the theoretical results, while the symbols square, circle, and tri- 
angle denote MC results. It is indicated that the theoretical results 
comply with the MC results pretty well. For comparison, the PDs 
of the SAMF and ASD are also given. It can be observed that the 
SAMF-ASD is much more exible in governing the detection per- 
¦Á is 
formance for mismatched subspace signals. When the weight 
large, the SAMF-ASD is very robust to mismatched subspace sig- 
¦Á is small, the SAMF-ASD is very selective 
nals. In contrast, when 
to mismatched subspace signals. 
Fig. 5 presents the contours of the PD of the SAMF-ASD, as a 
function of cos 
2 ¦Õ and SNR. This type of gure is a generaliza- 
tion of Fig. 4 . The results in Fig. 5 clearly show that the SAMF-

is large as cos 
 0.5, the SAMF-ASD with

PD of 0.9 when the SNR is larger than 26.5 dB. In contrast, with

value of the weight is needed, when a robust detector is needed, 
such as operating the radar system in surveillance model. More- 
over, a small value of the weight is needed, when a selective de-

References 

In this paper, a weighted detector for mismatched subspace 
signal detection, was proposed, namely, the SAMF-ASD. It is con- 
structed by linearly combining the SAMF and ASD. Analytical ex- 
pressions for the PD and PFA are derived. The SAMF-ASD can con- 
trol its robustness or selectivity in the presence of subspace sig-
