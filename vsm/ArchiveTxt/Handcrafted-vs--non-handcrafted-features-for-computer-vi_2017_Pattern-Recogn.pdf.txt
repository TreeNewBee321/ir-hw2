abstract

This work presents a generic computer vision system designed for exploiting trained deep Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNN) as a generic feature extractor and mixing these features with more traditional 
hand-crafted features. Such a system is a single structure that can be used for synthesizing a large num- 
ber of different image classication tasks. Three substructures are proposed for creating the generic com- 
puter vision system starting from handcrafted and non-handcrafter features: i) one that remaps the out- 
put layer of a trained CNN to classify a different problem using an SVM; ii) a second for exploiting the 
output of the penultimate layer of a trained CNN as a feature vector to feed an SVM; and iii) a third for 
merging the output of some deep layers, applying a dimensionality reduction method, and using these 
features as the input to an SVM. The application of feature transform techniques to reduce the dimen- 
sionality of feature sets coming from the deep layers represents one of the main contributions of this 
paper. Three approaches are used for the non-handcrafted features: deep transfer learning features based 
on convolutional neural networks (CNN), principal component analysis network (PCAN), and the com- 
pact binary descriptor (CBD). For the handcrafted features, a wide variety of state-of-the-art algorithms 
are considered: Local Ternary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence Local 
Binary Patterns, Completed Local Binary Patterns, Rotated local binary pattern image, Globally Rotation 
Invariant Multi-scale Co-occurrence Local Binary Pattern, and several others. The computer vision system 
based on the proposed approach was tested on many different datasets, demonstrating the generaliz- 
ability of the proposed approach thanks to the strong performance recorded. The Wilcoxon signed rank 
test is used to compare the different methods; moreover, the independence of the different methods is 
studied using the Q-statistic. To facilitate replication of our experiments, the MATLAB source code will be 
available at ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/bguw035yrqz0pwp/ElencoCode.docx?dl=0 ).

1. Introduction 

Many computer vision algorithms for image classication rely 
on the detection and extraction of local characteristics in images; 
as a result, much of the computer vision literature is focused on 
discovering, understanding, characterizing, and improving features 
that can be extracted from images. A large number of features re- 
ported in the literature have been manually designed, or ※hand- 
crafted,§ with an eye for overcoming specic issues like occlusions 
and variations in scale and illumination. The design of handcrafted 
features often involves nding the right trade-off between accuracy 
and computational eciency. The powerful Scale Invariant Feature 
Transform (SIFT) [1] , for example, is well-known for its robustness
to object rotation and scale variations, but this robustness comes 
at a high computational cost. The most widely used features of- 
ten generate an ensemble of variants to tackle the inherent short- 
comings in the speed and/or accuracy of the original versions. For 
example, some fast variants of SIFT [2] have been proposed to be 
used in real-time applications and on devices with low computa- 
tional power. 
The computation of handcrafted features, such as SIFT, is nor- 
mally a two-step process [3] . First, a keypoint detector locates 
characteristic regions of an image (e.g., corners), which are then 
characterized by calculating a descriptor that is capable of distin- 
guishing each particular keypoint from the others. This process is 
outlined in detail in [4] . The set of cues considered for building the 
descriptor depends on the specic feature being used. At a lower 
level, a descriptor is a vector of measurements that can be used to 
train a classier, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) [5] .

The deep learning paradigm [6] enables the creation of com- 
plex networks for solving (among the others) the problem of image 
classication, usually tackled by means of CNNs, where deep layers 
in these complex networks act as a set of feature extractors that 
are often quite generic and, to some extent, independent of any 
specic classication task [7] . This means that deep learning ob- 
tains a set of features learned directly from observations of the in- 
put images [8] , possibly preprocessed using a pyramidal approach 
[9] . The idea behind this approach is to discover multiple levels of 
representation so that higher level features can represent the se- 
mantics of the data, which in turn can provide greater robustness 
to intra-class variability [10] . Of interest here are the characteris- 
tics of the different layers in many deep neural networks that have 
been trained on images: rst layer features resemble either Gabor 
lters or color blobs and tend to be generalizable, i.e. transferable 
to many different datasets and tasks [11] . Therefore, it is possible 
to consider the deep layers of a CNN as a feature extractor, much 
like SIFT, the major difference being that the features extracted by 
a CNN are learned using the data in contrast to hand-crafted fea- 
tures that are designed beforehand by human experts to extract a 
given set of chosen characteristics. 
Because the features extracted by the lower levels of a CNN 
strongly depend on the training set, special care must be taken in 
the selection of the dataset. The choice of a representative train- 
ing dataset is usually performed by generating or selecting huge 
training sets, in the order of millions of images [12] . This solu- 
tion, however, is far from ideal, as it requires considerable human 
effort in the selection of images suitable for building the train- 
ing set and substantial computational power during the training 
phase. Both these drawbacks can partially be overcome by exploit- 
ing semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques [13] and parallel 
computing to reduce the human labor and the computational costs 
involved in the training. 
In Table 1 , we provide a brief descriptive summary of several 
recent deep transfer learning methods, including the approach pro- 
posed here for comparison purposes. 
In this paper, we are interested in exploiting features extracted 
by the deep layers of a network to build a general, or General- 
Purpose (GP), ensemble capable of handling a broad range of im- 
age classication problems. An ideal GP system is capable of pro- 
viding results comparable with state-of-the-art systems by work- 
ing out-of-the-box with little or no ne-tuning. Some recent pa- 
pers have investigated how it is possible to build heterogeneous 
GP ensembles [22每23] . For example, in [22] , a GP ensemble per- 
formed competitively compared with other state-of-the-art meth- 
ods across sixteen benchmark datasets representing very different 
problems (for instance, numerous medical problems, many image 
classication problems, a vowel dataset, and a credit card dataset). 
However, no single ensemble investigated in [22] worked consis- 
tently well across all sixteen datasets. Nonetheless, one GP ensem- 
ble worked well across all the image datasets〞on some datasets 
performing even better than an SVM whose parameters had been 
ne-tuned for that specic dataset. 

Several papers have also investigated GP ensembles that exploit 
the different types of information available using different feature 
extraction methods and representations of the data. In [23] , for ex- 
ample, the goal was to discover a GP ensemble for protein classi- 
cation that combined different types of protein representations and 
descriptors and that was capable of performing well across four- 
teen protein classication datasets representing several different 
classication problems. Again, no single ensemble was discovered 
that obtained top performance across all fourteen datasets; how- 
ever, it was shown that it is always possible to nd a more lim- 
ited GP ensemble that performs consistently well across each type 
of dataset. Finally, in [24] , a GP heterogeneous ensemble combin- 
ing many handcrafted and non-handcrafted features, including fea- 
tures taken from a specic layer of a deep neural network trained 
on a specic dataset, was able to perform competitively well across 
twenty-ve datasets (fourteen image datasets and eleven UCI data 
mining datasets). In some cases, it outperformed an SVM classier 
for which both the kernel and parameters selection were carefully 
ne-tuned for the datasets. 
Our goal in this paper is to build a better performing GP ensem- 
ble by comparing and combining state-of-the-art handcrafted fea- 
tures with non-handcrafted features. The handcrafted approaches 
considered in this paper include Local Ternary Patterns, Local 
Phase Quantization, Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence Local Bi- 
nary Patterns, Completed Local Binary Patterns, Rotated Local Bi- 
nary Pattern Image, Globally Rotation Invariant Multi-scale Co- 
occurrence Local Binary Pattern, as well as several others. The 
non-handcrafted features examined here include two recently pro- 
posed methods, the Principal Component Analysis Network (PCAN) 
[10] and the Compact Binary Descriptor (CBD) [25] ), as well as dif- 
ferent methods of deep transfer learning. The deep transfer learn- 
ing methods are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
trained to perform classication on the ImageNet ILSVRC challenge 
dataset. The approach chosen for the deep learners exploits the 
features provided by the last layer of the CNN along with the fea- 
ture set obtained from an internal layer. Two feature dimension- 
ality reduction methods (discrete cosine transform and principal 
component analysis) are used for reducing these feature sets since 
they often have high dimensionality. The features extracted from 
the CNN are then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
which implements the deep transfer learning approach. 
The contributions of this paper are twofold. The rst is our 
proposal of combining features extracted from the deep layers of 
CNNs with powerful handcrafted approaches to solve a classica- 
tion problem: in this way we are able to verify that each of the 
two feature extraction paradigms is capable of extracting informa- 
tion that is neglected by the other paradigm. In order to reduce the 
extremely large feature vectors that are extracted from deep layers 
(which could result in the curse of dimensionality [26每27] ), two 
reduction methods are employed: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) 
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The second contribution 
is our wide and thorough evaluation of the possible combinations 
of handcrafted and non-handcrafted features that are needed to 

160

build a generic computer vision classication system. This can be 
seen as a detailed guideline for synthesizing the GP computer vi- 
sion system concept outlined above. Such a guideline is of general 
interest because the system performance of our approach was eval- 
uated over a mix of very different com puter vision classication 
tasks in order to avoid any polarization of the proposed architec- 
ture. 
The different handcrafted and non-handcrafted features were 
compared and combined in this work, with their independence ex- 
amined using the Q-statistic [28] . The proposed GP ensemble ob- 
tains state-of-the-art results on a large set of different datasets. 
Performance differences among the methods are evaluated using 
the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The MATLAB source code to repli- 
cate our experiments will be available at ( https://www.dei.unipd.

2. Deep convolutional neural networks 

Deep learning has revolutionized the eld of machine learning. 
First proposed in 2006 [29] , the primary feature of deep learning is 
its layered structure. Deep learning can be implemented by means 
of several different algorithms, all of which are marked by a cas- 
cade of many processing layers organized in a hierarchical struc- 
ture. Each of these layers add a level of abstraction to the over- 
all representation. In the image interpretation task, layers close to 
the input deal with low-level features like edges and texture. These 
low-level features can be combined together to build a more com- 
plex representation. For example, at the second level, features like 
image patches and contours might be considered. Layer by layer, 
complexity increases. 
The approach to deep learning considered in this paper is based 
on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [30] . Several CNN soft- 
ware packages and MATLAB toolboxes are available to researchers. 
In this work, we use the MatConvNet toolbox for MATLAB, 
1 where 
CNNs are built by choosing a set of computational blocks (CBs) 
(a naming convention employed in the MatConvNet toolbox) that 
implements the data processing functions. These blocks are con- 
nected following a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each CB takes an 
input vector x and provides an output vector y that depends on x 
and on a set of parameters w that are learned during the train- 
ing phase. The MatConvNet toolbox provides a set of CBs that can 
be rearranged to form many different networks, thereby exploiting 
the modularity of the CNN structure. 
Below, the deep learning-based approaches considered in this 
work will be detailed. It should be pointed out that these ap- 
proaches are used as feature extraction methods where the output 
of each algorithm is considered as a feature vector and exploited in 
a fashion similar to how handcrafted features are commonly em- 
ployed. 

2.1. Principal component analysis network (PCANet) 

PCANet [10] is a simple deep learning network that is based on 
cascading PCA to learn multistage lter banks and on binary hash- 
ing and blockwise histograms for indexing and pooling. The idea 
behind PCANet is to produce a basic yet competitive deep learner 
for image classication that could be used to justify more com- 
plex deep learning strategies. There are no nonlinear operations in 
PCANet until the last output layer, which utilizes the binary hash- 
ing and blockwise histograms. 
PCANet implements a three stage process. Given a training set 
℅ n and assuming a patch size or 2D 
of N images 
of size m 
lter of size k 1 
at all stages, then the three stages can be 
described as follows: 

{

1 The toolbox is freely available at http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/ . 

Stage 1 - PCA: a patch is taken around each pixel, and all over- 
lapping patches of the i th image are collected: x i,
denotes the j th vectorized patch in I i 
, 
 m 
 . The mean patch is then subtracted 
from each patch, obtaining X i 
] , where x i, j 
is a 
mean-removed patch. Assuming the number of lters in layer i is 
, PCA minimizes the reconstruction error within a family of or- 
thonormal lters, with the leading principal eigenvectors captur- 
ing the main variation of all the mean-removed training patches. 
(

The PCA lters are expressed as W

T are the L 1 
principal eigenvectors, ma t k 1 
(
)
 is a func- 
tion mapping v 
k 2 to a matrix W 
( XX 
T ) is the 
L th principal eigenvector of XX 
Stage 2 - PCA: this is a process similar to stage 1. Let the L th 
lter output of stage 1 be I 
 As in stage 1, all the overlapping 
patches of I 
can be collected and the patch mean subtracted from 
each patch. The PCA lters W 
of stage 2 can then be obtained. 
The number of output images is L 1 
. Stage 2 can be repeated if 
need be to build a deeper architecture. 
Stage 3 - Output (Hashing and Histograms): each of the 
input images in I 
for stage 2 has L 2 
real value outputs 
 W 
. These outputs are binarized using a Heaviside step- 
 W 
 H (
)
like function 
, whose value is 1 for positive entries 
and 0 otherwise. Around each pixel, the binary bits of vector L 2 
are 
considered as a decimal number, thereby converting the L 2 
outputs 
into a single integer-valued ※image§ T 
with every pixel integer in 
L 2  1 ] . Each of the L 1 
the range [ 0 
images are then partitioned 
into B blocks. A histogram with 2 
L 2 bins of the decimal values in 
each block is computed, and all B histograms are concatenated into 
(T

one vector Bhist

2.2. Compact binary descriptor (CBD) 

The Compact Binary Descriptor (CBD) [25] , unlike most other 
binary descriptors such as LBP, is not handcrafted but is based on 
a learning method where Pixel Difference Vectors (PDVs) are ex- 
tracted from local patches by computing the difference between 
each pixel and its neighbors. Such PDVs are then projected in an 
unsupervised manner onto low-dimensional binary vectors such 
that the variance of the binary codes in the training set is maxi- 
mized and the loss of information between the original real-value 
codes and the binary codes is minimized. 
Let X 
 x n ] be the training set containing N sam- 
≒ n 
ples, where x n 
d is the n th pixel difference vector and 1 
≒ N , the aim of CBD is to learn K hash functions that map and 
quantize each x n into a binary vector b n 
℅ K that more compactly encodes the discriminative infor- 
mation. 
Letting W k 
d be the projection vector for the k th function, 
the k th binary code b nK of x n can be computed as b nK 
≡ 0 and 
1 otherwise.

The classication system proposed in this paper remaps a given 
deep CNN trained to solve a problem that is different from the one 
for which it was originally trained. Suppose A 
is a set of labels representing some classication problem into 
which a given input x should be classied, and let y 
(x 
)
 be the 
classication function implemented by the deep CNN [30] . Such 
a function takes the input vector x and provides an output vec- 
tor y of length N that contains the scores assigned to all possible 
outcomes considered in the classication problem. For example, 
the classication problem Animal might have the following out- 
come: Animal 
 { pig, dog, horse }. A deep CNN trained on this prob- 
lem would assign to each input image three values (under the im- 
plicit assumption that an input image will contain a pig, a dog, 
or a horse, or none of the three animal classes). The approach 
taken in this paper is to solve a different classication problem, say 
Tool 
 { Hammer, drill, screwdriver }, by considering the CNN scores 
assigned to some other problem, e.g. the Animal problem. 
Consider the scheme in Fig. 1 . Given a problem Q , the input x is 
sent to several different deep CNNs that have been trained to solve 
several different classication problems (e.g. A , B, C ), each charac- 
terized by a different number of labels ( M, N, and P, respectively). 
The three deep networks provide three output vectors: { a 0 
, ..., a M }, 
, ..., b N }, and { c 0 
, ..., c P }. These outputs then become the inputs to 
three SVMs that are trained to provide a result that solves problem 
Q . In other words, the SVMs learn the correlations between A , B, C , 

{ b 0 

=

and Q . The outputs of the three SVMs are then combined using the 
sum rule. 
It is important to note that only the three SVMs need be trained 
using this double-stage classication pipeline since the deep CNNs 
implement models that have already been trained for different 
problems〞a training phase, it should be noted, that was compu- 
tationally very expensive to accomplish. 
Input images are preprocessed before being sent to the CNNs. 
A rst preprocessing step required by the CNNs should guarantee 
a constant size for the input data. This means that images must be 
resized in order to have the same number of rows and columns. 
Furthermore, the average training image is subtracted from each 
image before processing, minimizing the outlier effect (i.e. uncom- 
mon pixel values) as suggested in [30] . The pretrained models used 
in this work are those available with the MatConvNet 
2 toolbox and 
are those used in [31每33] . These models are able to classify 10 0 0 
categories. 
The rationale behind our approach is based on the supposition 
that there is a certain degree of similarity between different classi- 
cation problems. In other words, it is assumed that a class a i 
be- 
longing to classication problem A will have some degree of sim- 
ilarity with another class b j 
belonging to classication problem B . 
Taken alone the degree of similarity will most likely be limited and 
lacking in discriminant power. To build a robust GP system it is 
necessary to consider multiple classication problems simultane- 
ously, allowing each one to bring to the table its own degree of 
similarity to the problem at hand. A system for assigning the sim- 
ilarities to this larger set of classes then needs to be trained. 
A large number of output classes is a key aspect of the CNNs 
employed in our system. However, the large number of features 
(partially correlated among them) provided by each CNN (which 
are the inputs of each SVM), coupled with the relatively small 
number of training samples that are commonly available in the 
datasets of the new problems (in the order of 50 0每20 0 0 images), 
can be a source of performance degradation due to the curse of 
dimensionality. This problem can be limited using a random sub- 
space (RS) ensemble [34] in place of a stand-alone classier since 
RS only considers randomly drawn subsets of the group of input 
features, resulting in a reduction of the number of input values. 
In this work, each random subspace ensemble is composed of 50 
SVMs combined by sum rule and trained using a random subset of 
50% of the given input values.

Many state-of-the-art descriptors are based on LBP [40] . These ap- 
proaches extract features that are general-purpose and are, there- 
fore, most suitable for building a generic computer vision systems. 

3.1. Local binary pattern (LBP) 

Fig. 2. Working principle of the feature extraction from inner layers. The output 
of each layer is considered as a feature vector; a dimensionality reduction method 
(PCA and DCT) is possibly applied, depending on the vector size. All vectors are 
then processed by an SVM to provide the nal output. 

2.4. Inner layers 

Unlike other approaches proposed in the literature, our system 
is not limited to the analysis of the output layer of the consid- 
ered CNN; rather, it extends the analysis to the features provided 
by deeper layers, as shown in Fig. 2 . CNNs for classication tasks 
are often designed in order to reduce the dimensionality of feature 
vectors while approaching the shallow layers: deep layers, there- 
fore, provide high dimensional vectors. Since these deep layer fea- 
ture vectors serve as inputs to the individual SVMs [5] that are 
used for synthesizing the transfer learning, the high dimensional- 
ity of these vectors needs to be counterbalanced in order to avoid 
the curse of dimensionality. 
The dimensionality reduction methods employed in this work 
are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and discrete cosine trans- 
form (DCT). PCA [35] is a popular method for unsupervised dimen- 
sionality reduction. It maps feature vectors into a smaller num- 
ber of uncorrelated directions calculated to preserve the global Eu- 
clidean structure. PCA also extracts an orthogonal projection ma- 
trix so that the variance of the projected vectors is maximized. The 
DCT transform [36] is a good compromise between information 
packing and computational complexity. Moreover, most DCT com- 
ponents are very small in magnitude, because most of the salient 
information exists in the coecients with low frequencies. For this 
reason, removing small coecients from the representation intro- 
duces only small errors in image reconstruction. 
Both PCA and DCT are used here to limit the dimension of the 
feature vector of each layer to 40 0 0 elements. What this means is 
that an orthogonal basis of 40 0 0 dimensions is provided by PCA, 
and the rst 40 0 0 frequencies are selected by DCT (the lower fre- 
quencies provide the highest information content). The dimension- 
ality reduction turned out to be quite strong, as the original feature 
length for the layers considered in this work reached dimensions 
of up to 10 0,0 0 0 as detailed below in Section 4.2 . 

3. Handcrafted features 

Handcrafted features have been used for more than a decade 
in a number of computer vision applications, including object de- 
tection and image classication. Over time, the number of features 
have increased to better adapt to the various tasks being tackled 
by researchers. Feature-based approaches can be considered state- 
of-the-art for the generic computer vision problem we are building 
in this paper. For this reason, we consider different f eature-based 
approaches as a reference point against which to compare the per- 
formance of feature-based systems exploiting a combination (en- 
semble) of different features. We believe this to be the best choice 
given that our recognition task is not specic but rather generic. 
The handcrafted features used in our comparisons are variations 
of three main approaches: Local Binary Pattern (LBP) [37] , Local 
Ternary Pattern (LTP) [38] and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) [39] . 

Proposed by Ojala et al. [37] , LBP has rapidly become a popular 
descriptor mainly because of its low computational complexity and 
ability to code ne details. The canonical LBP operator [37] is com- 
puted at each pixel location by considering the values of a small 
circular neighborhood (with radius R pixels) around the value of a 
central pixel I c , as follows: 

LBP (

 N,

 R )

=

 I c 

)

 I n

where N is the number of pixels in the neighborhood, R is the ra- 
≡ 0, otherwise s( x ) 
dius , and s( x ) 
 1 if x 
 0. The descriptor is the 
histogram of these binary numbers.

3.2. Local ternary pattern (LTP) 

(cid:7)

One variant that has inspired many others is the Local Ternary 
Patterns (LTP), proposed by Tan and Triggs [38] , which utilizes a 3- 
valued encoding scheme that includes a threshold around zero for 
the evaluation of the local gray-scale difference. The ternary coding 
而 in the canonical 
is accomplished by introducing the threshold 
LBP s(x) function: 
 x |

1 
0 
Because of the length of the ternary coding, the original LTP 
code is split into a positive and a negative LBP code.

3.3. Local phase quantization (LPQ) 

The LPQ operator, rst proposed by Ojansivu and Heikkila [39] , 
is based on the blur invariance property of the Fourier phase spec- 
trum and uses the local phase information extracted from the 2-D 
short-term Fourier transform (STFT) computed over a rectangular 
neighborhood at each pixel position of the image. 
In the Fourier domain, the model for spatially invariant blurring 
of an image, g( x ), is: 
G (
 u )
 F (
 u )
 H (
 u )

(6)

.

where G( u ), F(u), and H( u ) are the discrete Fourier transforms 
(DFT) of the blurred image g ( x ), the original image f ( x ), and the 
point spread function (PSF) h ( x ), respectively, and u is a vector of 
coordinates [ u, v ] 
The magnitude and phase aspects in ( 6 ) can be separated. Thus,

In the case where the blur h ( x ) is centrally symmetric, the 
Fourier transform is always real-valued, and its phase is a two- 
≡ 0, 
valued function given by 
 0 if H ( u )

The LPQ method uses the local phase information extracted us- 
ing STFT computed over a rectangular neighborhood N x of size M

3.4. Other LBP variants 

Variants explored in this paper that are based on the above 
handcrafted methods are detailed in Table 2 , which provides a 
brief description of each variant. 

4. Experimental results 

To test our approach, we selected several datasets that include 
very different image types. A large variety of image types is crucial 
for demonstrating the generalizability of our approach and for pro- 
viding stable results and high accuracy irrespective of the specic 
problem being addressed. The datasets selected include, among 
many others, medical and subcellular images, pictures of smoke, 
and images of ancient books, ora, and paintings. All the following 
datasets used in our experiments are publicly available: 
 PS (Pap Smear dataset) [48] : includes images of cells used in 
the diagnosis of cervical cancer.

 KU (buttery dataset) [59] : contains 140 buttery images 
representing fourteen different buttery species of the Styri- 
dae family. Each of the buttery images was cropped to a 
℅ 256 pixel image before processing and divided in two 
256 
equal regions (an upper and a lower region) without overlap. 
For each region a different SVM was trained and combined by 
sum rule. 
 FM : Flickr Material Database: contains images of ten material 
categories in the database: fabric, foliage, glass, leather, metal, 
paper, plastic, stone, water and wood. Each category has 100 
images, 50 of which are close-up views while the remaining 
50 offer views at object-scale. There is a binary, human-labeled 
mask associated with each image describing the location of the 
object. We only consider pixels inside this binary mask for ma- 
terial recognition and disregard all the background pixels. We 
use the same split suggested by the authors of the dataset. 
State-of-the-art computer vision systems still achieve a perfor- 
mance level that is lower than that of humans (human beings 
achieve an accuracy of 84.9%). 
 SR (scene dataset) [60] : contains images of scenes divided into 
fteen classes. This dataset is widely used in the literature. The 
testing protocol established by other papers, which we follow, 
requires ve experiments, each using 100 randomly selected 
images per category for training and the remaining images for 
testing. Each image is divided into four equal regions without 
overlap and a central region of 1/2 the size of the original im- 
age. For each region, a different SVM is trained, and the ve 
SVMs are combined by sum rule. 

The datasets detailed above are summarized in Table 3 , which 
shows the number of classes, the number of samples, the image 
size, and the URL for downloading the data. Unless otherwise spec- 
ied in the description of the dataset, the protocol used in our ex- 
periments is a ve-fold cross-validation method. 
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) [61] is used to assess 
performance. AUC is calculated using the one-versus-all approach 
[62] for multiclass problems. Experiments were statistically vali- 
dated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test [63] . 

is reported in Table 4 for the following combinations of deep CNN 
and SVM: 

S1: the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19 pretrained model and a 
stand-alone SVM is used as the classier; 
C1: the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19 pretrained model; 
C2: the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16 pretrained model; 
C3: the imagenet-vgg-f pretrained model; 
C4: the imagenet-vgg-m pretrained model; 
C5: the imagenet-vgg-s pretrained model; 
C6: the imagenet-vgg-m-2048 pretrained model; 
C7: the imagenet-vgg-m-1024 pretrained model; 
C8: the imagenet-vgg-m-128 pretrained model; 
C9: the imagenet-caffe-ref pretrained model; 
C10: the imagenet-caffe-alex pretrained model. 

Table 4 also reports the performance of the following ensem- 
bles: 

E1: the sum rule of C1 and C2; 
E2: the sum rule of C1, C3, and C9; 
E3: fusion, by sum rule, of all ten RS-SVMs trained with C1-C10. 

Examining Table 4 , it is clear that the ensembles improve the 
performance of the stand-alone CNN. The best performance is ob- 
tained by combining all the CNNs, E3 outperforming all the other 
methods with a p-value of 0.05. In addition, C1 (based on RS-SVM) 
greatly outperforms S1 (based on the stand-alone SVM) with a p- 
value of 0.01. We tested intersection, linear, and radial basis func- 
tion kernels for SVM for all the tested descriptors. The optimal pa- 
rameters were found using an internal 5-fold cross-validation pro- 
tocol inside the training set. 
It is interesting to note that RS boosts performance with the 
non-handcrafted descriptors, a performance boost that is probably 
due to the correlation among the features. In contrast, the RS en- 
semble using handcrafted features results in only a very marginal 
gain in performance [24] . 

4.1. Class scores as features 

The aim of the rst experiment, reported in Table 4 , is to es- 
tablish the usefulness of extracting features using the proposed ap- 
proach. If not specied, the RS-SVM is used as the classier. During 
the testing phase, all the pretrained models provided by the Mat- 
ConvNet toolbox were considered. The performance level achieved 

To reduce the computation time, only stand-alone SVMs are 
trained in the following tests. Preliminary tests showed that an RS 
ensemble produced a very small performance improvement. We 
use an Intersection kernel when the features are the output of a 
layer of CNN or when the output is reduced by DCT. When the 
output is reduced by PCA, a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is

used before feeding into an SVM. Experimentally DCT works bet- 
ter with Intersection kernel and PCA with RBF kernel. The dimen- 
sionality reduction methods were applied to features larger than 
50 0 0 elements, which were shown by the imagenet-vgg-verydeep- 
19 model in its layers #30 (100,352 elements) and #38 (25,088 el- 
ements). Other layers considered in this study (#39, #40, #41 and 
#42) produce feature vectors of 4096 elements that were not re- 
duced. Both DCT and PCA were set to output a feature vector di- 
mension of 40 0 0 elements: such a number is not a ratio of the 
input dimension but rather was chosen to sidestep the curse of 
dimensionality while training the SVM. For the sake of space, we 
have reported only the most interesting results. 
In Table 5 we compare different approaches for deep transfer 
learning: 

 Base: the CNN (the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19 model), where 
output of layer #42 is used for describing the images; 
 DCT: the CNN (the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19 model), where 
output of layer #38 is reduced by DCT, and the DCT coecients 
are used for describing the images; 
 PCA: the CNN (the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19 model), where 
output of layer #38 is reduced by PCA, and the PCA coecients 
are used for describing the images;

As it can be seen from the results reported in Table 5 , a set 
of SVMs using different layers improves performance: ( B 
outperforms base with a p-value of 0.05; (30 
 38 
 42) outper- 
forms ( B 
 D ) with a p-value of 0.05; and (MM) outperforms 
(30 
 38 
 42) with a p-value of 0.01. 
In Table 6 we report the layers used for each model of the en- 
semble labelled MM. It should be noted that if the feature set ex- 
tracted from a layer has a dimension higher than 50 0 0 then it is 
reduced by PCA and DCT.

4.4. Performance of handcrafted features and their fusions with 
non-handcrafted features 

The aim of the experiment reported in Table 8 is to compare 
the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art texture descrip- 
tors detailed in Section 3 . Below we provide details of the param- 
eters used in this experiment: 
 Local Ternary Patterns (LTP) [38] : features were extracted us- 
ing a threshold of 3, and the concatenation of the feature sets 
was obtained with (radius 
 1; number of neighborhood 
 8) 
and (radius 
 2; number of neighborhood 
 16); only uniform 
bins were extracted; 
 Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) [39] : concatenation of the fea- 
ture sets was obtained with local window sizes of 3 and 5; 
 Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence LBP (RICLBP) [41] : features 
were extracted by concatenating the feature sets obtained with 
the scale of LBP radius (s) and the interval of LBP pair ( r ) of 
( s 
 1, r 
 2) ( s 
 2, r 
 4) ( s 
 4, r 
 8);

 Discriminative Completed Local Binary Pattern [43] (dis- 
CLBP_v2): the best approach was used and labeled as in the 
original paper dis(S 
 M), with the number of neighborhoods 8 
and with the radius 
 1, 3, and 5; 
 disCLBP: as with disCLBP_v2, but with the following param- 
eters: (radius 
 1; number of neighborhood 
 8), (radius 
 2; 
number of neighborhood 
 16), and (radius 
 3; number of 
neighborhood 
 24); 
 Complete Local Binary Pattern (CLBP) [42] : features were 
extracted by concatenating the feature set obtained with 
(radius 
 1; number of neighborhood 
 8) and (radius 
 2; num- 
ber of neighborhood 
 16). 
 Rotated Local Binary Pattern image (RLBP) [44] : features were 
extracted by concatenating the feature set obtained with 
(radius 
 1; number of neighborhood 
 8) and (radius 
 2; num- 
ber of neighborhood 
 16). Uniform bins are extracted; 
 RLBPselec: all bins are extracted with (radius 
 1; num- 
ber of neighborhood 
 8) and (radius 
 2; number of 
neighborhood 
 16); then a feature selection process is ap- 
plied based on the frequency of the patterns (exactly as in the 
original paper [44] ) using a threshold of 0.9; 
 MrElbp [45] : default parameter settings in the original journal 
paper were used: radius taking the value of {2, 4, 6, 8} and a 
point set of 8. Images are resized to a xed dimension (height 
of 150 pixel) before feature extraction; 
 Msjlbp [46] : using the default parameters for the code;

were calculated from 5 different scale levels and 14 different

followed by level one, where the image is subdivided into four 
quadrants.

In Table 8 the fusion between handcrafted and non-handcrafted 
features is reported in the rows labelled Fus . As it can be observed, 
handcrafted features capture information that is different from the 
system proposed in this paper. We checked the error independence 
with Yule＊s Q-statistic [28] (Q-stat). The values of Q are bounded 
1,1]. Classiers that recognize the same patterns cor- 
between [ 
rectly have Q 
 0; those which commit errors on different pat- 
terns have Q 
 0. In Table 8 , the Q-statistic is reported between 
handcrafted and non-handcrafted features in the row labelled Q- 
stat . Results show that different descriptors train a set of partially 
uncorrelated classiers. For this reason, the fusion between hand- 
crafted and non-handcrafted features outperforms the handcrafted 
features ( p -value 0.01). 
To avoid presenting a large table, we report the fusion and the 
q-statistic between the handcrafted and non-handcrafted features 
for the three best performing handcrafted features only. 
For the state-of-the-art handcrafted feature approaches, we 
used methods where the original code is available, and we used 
the parameters settings suggested by the original authors. Some 
performance differences, com pared to the original papers, are ob- 
tained on some datasets (e.g. disCLBP in the PS dataset). This is 
due to the different parameter testing protocols. We used the same 
split for the training/testing sets for all the methods tested in this 
paper, as well as the same approach for nding the parameters of 
SVM. 
Of course, a higher performance could be obtained if different 
feature descriptors were combined with different classiers. The 
aim of this work, however, is not to propose the best ensemble 
of descriptors that optimizes the classication step; rather, it is to 
show how to use different pre-trained CNNs and the different lay- 
ers of these CNNs for obtaining a very high performing set of fea- 
tures. Since the proposed method is tested on several different im- 
age datasets, we are fairly condent about the generalizability of 
the proposed approach. 

4.5. Validation against ensembles proposed in the literature 

In this subsection, we have reported the performance of a sys- 
tem based on handcrafted and non-handcrafted features in a set 
of bioimage datasets used in literature for validating ensembles of 
descriptors for medical images (cell phenotype recognition, subcel- 
lular localization, and histopathological classication). Our method 
obtains a performance that is comparable with the best ensemble 
proposed in the literature [65] . Moreover, as Table 9 shows, our 
method outperforms several other approaches that have been pro- 
posed in the last few years. An advantage of our method is that 
it is not based on complex, computationally expensive image-level 
statistics of a dense set of local descriptors, as is the case with [65] . 
Furthermore, the full MATLAB source code for reproducing our ex- 
periments is freely available, while the source code used in [65] is 
not. Thus, our method could be very useful for practitioners. 
For the non-handcrafted features, we use the best approach

normalized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. 
The set of biological images is labelled IICBU 2008 Benchmark 
[68] ; some datasets in that suite (CH, HE and RN) are already de- 
tailed in Table 3 . The other datasets referenced in Table 9 are the 
following: 
 Muscle aging (MA): the classes are images of C. elegans muscles 
at 4 ages; 
 Terminal bulb aging (TB): images of C. elegans terminal bulb at 
7 ages (hence, 7 classes); 
 Lymphoma (LY): malignant lymphoma of three subtypes; 
 Liver gender (LG): liver tissue sections from 6-month male and 
female mice on a caloric restriction diet (the classes are the 2 
genders); 
 Liver aging (LA): liver tissue sections from female mice on ad- 
libitum diet of 4 ages. 

As was the case in all the experiments reported above, for 
our descriptors we always use the same parameters across all the 
tested datasets to avoid any overtting. It will also be noted that 
in Table 9 we use accuracy as the performance indicator as this is 
the performance indicator that is used in the literature when ac- 
cessing an ensemble＊s performance on the IICBU 2008 benchmark 
dataset. 
Except for [65] , our method HERE outperforms all the other ap- 
proaches reported in Table 9 with a p-value of 0.1. HERE also out- 
performs the ensemble of handcrafted features named Hand. It is 
clear that our set of features extracted using CNN builds a very 
high performing ensemble of descriptors. 

5. Conclusions 

In this work, the exploitation of deep learning-based features 
for synthesizing a generic image classication system was ana- 
lyzed. This was done by describing an input image using a feature 
vector built with non-handcrafted features: deep transfer learn- 
ing features based on convolutional neural networks, principal 
component analysis network, and the compact binary descriptor. 
The image representation method developed in this paper is gen- 
eral, geared to work eciently for any image classication prob- 
lem. This is veried by the high number of different datasets and 
classication tasks employed while developing the system. Non- 
handcrafted features extracted from the input images were used 
for training an SVM on a wide range of image classication prob- 
lems. Several CNNs were used for extracting a set of feature vec- 
tors from an image, which were then used to feed an ensemble of 
SVMs that were nally combined by sum rule. 
The proposed method was compared with an analogous sys- 
tem based on handcrafted features, an image description method

widely used in the literature. Several state-of-the-art handcrafted 
descriptors (LTP and LPQ, and some other powerful LBP variants) 
were used to compare the eciency of the image description 
method proposed in this paper against the state of the art on a 
number of different datasets. 
The large dimensionality of feature sets extracted from the deep 
layers cannot be handled using the best performing feature selec- 
tion techniques like [75] : for this reason, DCT and PCA were used 
in this work. However, this approach can be developed further, us- 
ing, for example, high performing feature selection, such as kernel 
partial least square [76] or Lagrange multipliers [77] ; these could 
be applied to the output of DCT and PCA for a further dimensional- 
ity reduction, thereby limiting the curse of dimensionality. Alterna- 
tively, faster feature selection methods, like Fisher score, Gini index 
or T-test (Duda, Hart, Stork, and pattern classication), can be di- 
rectly applied to the original feature sets extracted from the deep 
layers. 
The experimental results demonstrated that the performance 
achieved using our transfer learning scheme is higher than what is 
achievable by other standard approaches. The experimental results 
comparing handcrafted features against non-handcrafted features 
show that the two systems extract different information from the 
input images. As a result, the fusion of handcrafted features with 
the novel features proposed in this paper greatly outperforms the 
standard approaches with a p-value of 0.01.
